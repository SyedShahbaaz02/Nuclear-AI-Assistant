|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Choose Azure AI Search as Search Technology Option | 03-12-2025 | Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL DB, Self-Hosted Chroma DB | It meets the minimum requirements for our search needs in addition to a plethora of additional features. | [Choose Azure AI Search](./001-choose-azure-ai-search.md) | Mary Sha | N/A |
| Begin with a baseline implementation using NUREG-1022 data | 04-02-2025 | Using historical LERs, ENSs, Reportability Manual | NUREG-1022 is non-ECI data that is most like the Reportability manual. By beginning with a baseline implementation, it will also allow us to begin work on evaluation strategy. | [Start Baseline](./002-start-nureg-architecture.md) | Mary Sha | <https://dev.azure.com/ConstellationADO/Generation%20Digital/_workitems/edit/954593/> <https://dev.azure.com/ConstellationADO/Generation%20Digital/_workitems/edit/954595/>|
| Evaluate Chat Protocol for communication between backend and frontend with regards to chat | 03-13-2025 | Azure SignalR | Least complex implementation that meets the requirements of the engagement. | [Chat Protocol](./003-chat-protocol.md) | Shawn Gaul | N/A |
| Use the Azure Monitor family of services and OpenTelemetry | 05-13-2025 | N/A | The Azure Monitor family of services provide for simple, Azure Wide logging of service and application telemetry and diagnotist data.  OpenTelemetry is the defacto industry for cross-platform distributed application logging and tracing | [Observability Approach](./004-observability-approach.md) | Bret Stateham | N/A |
| Leverage Bicep and Azure DevOps Pipelines to deploy resources to the Azure Government Cloud Development and Staging environments | 05-14-2025 | Manual Deployment via the portal, manually executed scripts leverageing the Azure CLI from the command line | Bicep ensures repeatable and reliable configuration of the necessary resources, and Azure DevOps Pipelines enable secure deployment with the proper credentials and access to secrets | [Azure Resource Deployment](./005-azure-resource-deployment.md) | Bret Stateham | TBD |
| Search Index Design | 6/12/2025 | N/A | N/A | [Search Index](./006-search-index.md) | Marc Lerwick | N/A |
| Multiphased approach for Search Evaluation | 06-18-2025 | Waterfall style, wait until everything is in place | A multiphased approach allows for rapid development early in the project with refinements as the project develops. Ultimately resulting in an evaluation process that uses user's actual queries. | [Search Evaluation](./007-search-evaluation.md) | Marc Lerwick | [Phase 2](https://dev.azure.com/ConstellationADO/Generation%20Digital/_workitems/edit/966545) |
| Multiphased approach for End to End Evaluation | 06-19-2025 | Waterfall style, wait until everything is in place | A multiphased approach allows for rapid devlopment early in the project with refinements as the project develops. Ultimately resulting in an evaluation process that uses user's actual queries. | [End to End Evaluation](./008-end-to-end-evaluation.md) | Marc Lerwic  | None yet |
