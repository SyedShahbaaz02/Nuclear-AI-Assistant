"On August 18, 2014, approximately 14 hours into a 24-hour surveillance test of Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) 1B, Operators noted cylinder 5L exhaust temperature decreased by 130 degrees Fahrenheit and power indication began oscillating. Operations began an orderly shutdown of EDG 1B. Subsequently, Operators in the diesel room reported an unusual noise, at which time Operations immediately unloaded and stopped EDG 1B. EDG 1B was subsequently repaired and tested satisfactorily. On August 21, 2014, McGuire Unit 1 requested a Notice of Enforcement Discretion (NOED) in anticipation of exceeding TS 3.8.1 ""AC Sources - Operating"" Required Action Completion Time. The NOED was granted by the NRC on the same day. The cause of the EDG 1B cylinder 5L failure is high cycle fatigue of the inlet valve due to the combined effects of three inlet valve train parts which were manufactured outside of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specified tolerances. Procurement of the applicable parts has been placed on hold until the parts specification is revised.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On November 18, 2024, at 0830, the 2-01 turbine driven auxiliary feedwater (TDAFW) pump was found in an inoperable condition following a change from Mode 4 to Mode 3 that occurred on 11/17/2024 at 1633. Operations personnel identified that the TDAFW remained uncoupled following maintenance during a Unit 2 refueling outage. Auxiliary feedwater (AFW) is required by Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operability (LCO) 3.7.5 to be operable in Modes 1, 2, and 3 with no exception allowed by TS LCO 3.0.4 for mode changes when applicable conditions are not met. The TDAFW was returned to service on November 18, 2024 at 2051. The cause was imprecise work instruction. This cause resulted in an incorrect interpretation of the work and post work testing scope. The applicable Maintenance procedure will be revised to correct the cause.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On April 23, 2015, following an engineering evaluation, it was determined that during a period of 12 minutes from 14:05 to 14:17 Eastern Daylight Time on March 21, 2015, Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) 3 and 4 could potentially have been unable to tie to their respective emergency busses. This was due to relays in breaker control logic that were susceptible to electrical noise from nearby relays de-energizing that could have prevented the output breakers from properly closing under certain conditions. This is considered a loss of safety function of the onsite standby alternating current (AC) power source. Three of four EDGs are required to mitigate an accident on one unit while maintaining the other unit in a safe condition. The cause of EDG 3 and 4 loss of safety function was electrical noise that caused relays to oscillate, preventing the EDG output breakers from remaining closed. A relay model not susceptible to noise interference was installed in EDG 4 breaker control logic on March 22, 2015. A voltage transient suppression device was installed on EDG 3 breaker control logic on March 23, 2015.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']
"On February 7, 2015, with the reactor in mode 4, an Electromatic Relief Valve (ERV) actuator failed to open during the performance of an extent of condition test. The testing involved an operator manually actuating the ERV from the main control room with operators and engineers staged in the field. However, when the demand signal was given, the 2C actuator plunger did not move and the valve did not open. The cause of this event was determined to be a lack of maintenance procedural guidance to align, determine excessive wear, and characterize wear of the ERV actuator sub-components. Corrective actions involved replacement of all four ERVs with an upgraded design and the development of enhanced inspection/maintenance guidance. This failure was determined to be of very low safety significance because the cause of the failure only existed on one ERV. This event is being reported under ""Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications"" and ""Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfilment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequence of an accident.""","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
"On November 1, 2020, at 0534, Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) Control Room Operators inserted a manual reactor scram due to low Digital Electro-Hydraulic (DEH) tank level. Further investigation revealed that a leak had developed at governor valve (GV) 1 and a pencil-sized stream of EH fluid was discovered leaking out of the lower outboard inspection port on the GV1 actuator. Investigation revealed one bolt on the actuator inspection port cover plate was bottomed-out and prevented appropriate tightening for an adequate seal. The o-ring on this cover plate was ruptured, allowing excessive leakage. The cause was on-site vendor craftsmanship was unsatisfactory in the failure to recognize the bottomed-out bolt during actuator installation, and inspector port cover plate holes on the new GV1 actuator body were not threaded deep enough to meet vendor specifications. CNS will appropriately classify critical Turbine Generator Fluid connections that are subject to additional verification of bolting and torqueing performance. In addition, CNS will review the final vendor evaluation of the actuator manufacturing defects/field craftsmanship and determine if additional actions are warranted. This event was not risk significant.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"At 0630 on the morning of April 1, 2014, with James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAFNPP) operating at 100 percent power and the ""A"" Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) subsystem inoperable for maintenance, a control room alarm annunciated indicating a problem with the ""B"" division safety pump room ventilation system. At 0645 a field operator identified the exhaust fan for the ""B"" division safety pump room ventilation system had tripped on thermal overload. Ventilation loss when the pumps are in service would degrade the long-term performance of residual heat removal service water (RHRSW) and emergency service water (ESW) systems; degradation of the ""B"" ESW pump would degrade the performance of the ""B"" EDG subsystem. The overload relay was reset at 0704 and the fan automatically started restoring ventilation; time out of service was thirty-four minutes. The ambient temperature limit in the ""B"" division safety pump room was never challenged. The equipment failure evaluation has determined the preliminary cause of the tripping of the fan to be the weakening of the Bi-Metal trip element that is heated by the current that causes the trip. This component will be replaced and the unit tested to confirm cause.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
"On February 27, 2015, during the performance of surveillance procedure 3-PT-R006A, three main steam safety valves (MSSV) (MS-46-2, MS-45-4, and MS-47-4) failed their As-Found lift set point test. Per the test, these valves must lift at +/- 3% of their required setting. During the test, 7 other MSSVs tested passed their As-Found test criteria. Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.1 (Main Steam Safety Valves) requires the MSSVs to be operable in accordance with TS Table 3.7.1-1 and Table 3.7.1-2. Due to the number of failures, during power ascension the remaining MSSVs were tested and two failed (MS-46-2, MS-46-3). MSSV MS-46-2 had previously failed and had maintenance performed therefore the failure was considered a post maintenance test failure. MS-46-3 failed its first lift test by 0.6% but met test lift criteria on the second and third test. TS Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.7.1.1 requires each MSSV be verified to lift per Table 3.7.1-2 in accordance with the In-service Testing Program. Operability of the MSSVs includes the ability to open within the set point tolerances. The direct cause of the failure of these valves was severely worn spindle rods. The apparent cause for the failure of MS-47-4 and MS-46-2 was internal friction due to spindle vibration. The apparent cause of the failure of MS-45-4 was reuse of a worn spindle. The apparent cause of the failure of MS-46-3 is foreign material. Corrective actions included testing all 20 MSSVs and adjusting their set point to be within +/- 1% of design set pressure. Installed new spindles and bronze wear sleeves on valves MS-46-4, MS-46-2, MS-47-4, MS-48-2, MS-49-2, MS-49-1, MS-49-3, and replaced the spindle on valve MS-45-4. The Unit 3 MSSV test frequency will be changed from 4 years to 2 years until all modifications are implemented and IPEC is confident the issue is resolved. The event had no effect on public health and safety.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On October 14, 2019, while in Mode 5, both Source Range (SR) Nuclear Instruments (NIs) were inoperable simultaneously. NI-32 was inoperable on October 12 for surveillance testing and was restored by October 15. NI-31 was removed from service to support an emergent maintenance activity on October 14 and was restored the same day. However, NI-31 remained inoperable after restoration due to an invalid indication of a steadily increasing count rate. This issue was not identified until October 15, 2019, when NI-31 failed a channel check. Work was planned to address NI-31 with NI-32 operable. However, on November 8, 2019, while in Mode 6, NI-32 began exhibiting an invalid count increase. This was identified on November 9, 2019, after a failed channel check, and NI-32 was declared inoperable. NI-31 and NI-32 were inoperable simultaneously until NI-32 was repaired on November 9, 2019. NI-31 was repaired November 15, 2019. The cause of NI-31's degraded performance was borated water intrusion into the detector well from overfilling the lower reactor cavity the previous outage. The cause of NI-32's degraded performance was a failed potentiometer.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A)']
On August 22  2013 at 1340  while operating at 100% power  during the performance of Surveillance Test Procedure (STP) 3.5.3-02  RCIC System Operability Test  the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) turbine tripped on electronic over-speed immediately upon startup. Subsequent troubleshooting found the RCIC governor controls dropping resistor in the power supply circuit to be partially open. This resulted in less than adequate power supply to the RCIC electronic governor which allowed the RCIC turbine to over-speed and trip on electronic over-speed. The RCIC governor controls dropping resistor was replaced and RCIC was returned to service on August 24  2013 at 0515. A past operability evaluation determined that the RCIC system was inoperable from June 21  2013 to August 23  2013  which is in excess of Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.3 Limiting Condition for Operation Completion Time. Therefore  this event resulted in a Condition Prohibited by TS. The Root Causes of this event were a failed dropping resistor and an inadequate Operability screening of a Condition Report. The safety significance for this event was very low based on fact that RCIC could have been operated in manual as directed by existing procedures.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"A review of plant reactor coolant temperature trends from a planned outage shows that on April 29, 2013, reactor coolant temperature was raised from approximately 135 degrees F to approximately 180 degrees F as a planned evolution. On April 30, 2013, RCS temperature was raised from approximately 180 degrees F to approximately 345 degrees F as a planned evolution. Additionally, on April 30, 2013, plant operations involving water additions to the Volume Control Tank were conducted. A review of the Station Log shows that only one ENI log channel was operable during these evolutions. These evolutions were prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications under these conditions. TS 3.3.1 Action 4 requires, with only one log power channel operable in Mode 5 or Mode 4, suspending ""all operations involving positive reactivity changes,"" and is clarified by an applicable note which states, ""Limited plant cooldown or boron dilution is allowed provided the change is accounted for in the calculated shutdown margin."" Planned corrective action is to revise the TS bases for TS 3.3.1 to emphasize the limitations for usage of the note applicable to Action 4. The planned heatup and dilution evolutions had no discernable effect on nuclear safety.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On June 07, 2021, Unit 2 was operating at approximately 100% power. At 1527, a fault occurred in Unit 2 Main Transformer Number 1 (2MT1) which resulted in a generator lockout relay automatic trip of the Unit 2 Main Turbine and reactor. Arcing between the ""B"" phase high voltage bushing and adjacent components on the top of the main transformer ignited the remaining bushing dielectric material and bushing oil. Automatic fire suppression was initiated and the fire was extinguished in 19 minutes. Entry into the Emergency Plan was not required. Operators responded to the event in accordance with approved procedures and safely placed the plant in Mode 3. The cause of this event was failure of the 2MT1 ""B"" phase high voltage bushing. The cause of the 2MT1 ""B"" phase high voltage bushing failure has not yet been determined. A failure analysis on the bushing is being performed. Results of the failure analysis will be provided in a supplemental report. Other corrective actions include repair or replacement of the damaged 2MT1 transformer components, post-work electrical diagnostic testing, oil sample testing, and an extent of condition review. All times are in Central Daylight Time (CDT).",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"The event occurred on October 29, 2020 while Peach Bottom Unit 2 was performing Class 1 system leakage test following a shutdown for refueling outage P2R23. Leakage was identified from a 2-inch Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) instrumentation nozzle (N-16A) during the test at a location where no leakage was found during the initial shutdown inspections. The leakage amount was identified as light seepage and visual examination revealed a surface crack at the 6 o'clock position on the interior RPV-instrument nozzle interface where the nozzle penetrates the vessel wall. Prior to de-pressurizing, an extent of condition bare metal examination was conducted on other instrument nozzles. No leakage was identified from any other instrument nozzles. Although the exact cause is unknown, phased array UT examination recorded a radial flaw in the N-16A J-Groove weld. A half nozzle repair was completed, consisting of replacing the outer portion of the existing nozzle with a new nozzle that was welded to the outside of the RPV. The reactor maintained shutdown until the pipe repairs and testing were completed. The safety significance of this event was minimal given the leakage was very small and was found while the reactor was shut down. Given the impact on the RPV boundary, this report is submitted. On November 6, 2020, verbal approval for relief request 15R-14 regarding alternate repair of instrument penetration nozzle N-16A on the reactor vessel was received via email from J. Tobin (U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission) to D. Helker (Exelon Generating Company, LLC.) reference ADAMS: ML20314A028.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A)']
On 9/23/2024 failure of the Main Generator Field Circuit Breaker (41M-2EXSX01) [EXC] lead to a Generator Field Loss of Excitation [TL]. This resulted in a Main Generator Lockout which caused a Turbine Trip [TA] and automatic anticipatory RPS actuation [JC] at 07:20. High resistance across Main Generator Field Circuit Breaker (41M-2EXSX01) caused a large voltage drop across the breaker main contacts. The Auto Voltage Regulator (AVR) [90] control system responded to the lower excitation through the feedback and increased output to compensate. The increased output resulted in increased voltage drop  heat at the contacts  a subsequent fire  and Loss of Field Excitation. The resulting Turbine Trip and Turbine Stop and Control Valve closure caused an automatic anticipatory RPS actuation.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On May 2, 2015, the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant (MNGP) was in Mode 5 for a refueling outage. During performance of surveillances of the non-credited 4kV essential Bus, MNGP experienced a loss of the 4kV Bus and essential Load Center due to an improperly landed jumper wire. Loss of the Load Center de-energized the valve position indication on the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) shutdown cooling inboard isolation valve, causing a subsequent trip of the RHR pump operating in shutdown cooling on a pump suction interlock and a loss of normal shutdown cooling. Control Room operators entered the appropriate abnormal procedures and verified alternate decay heat removal was in service until shutdown cooling could be restored. Immediate corrective actions included suspension of all work pending approval of the shift manager to ensure outage activities did not further degrade plant conditions and electrical work was limited to protect shutdown cooling. The essential Load Centers were cross-tied to restore normal shutdown cooling. Corrective actions include revising procedures to reinforce human performance tools, adequately assess risk involved with electrical work, and ensuring effective barriers are in place to harden residual heat removal function during shutdown conditions.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B)']
"At 1250 on October 21  2011  at the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant  a 2R Auxiliary Transformer lockout unexpectedly occurred causing off-site power to automatically transfer to the 1R Auxiliary Transformer  which resulted in a reactor scram. One cable of the ""A"" phase conductor  supplying power from 2RS to 2R Transformer  faulted to ground  resulting in the 3N4 breaker opening  as designed  to protect 2RS Transformer and other equipment from fault current damage. Subsequent testing indicates the cable suffered from environmental and age-related degradation. Implementation efforts to replace the cables between 2R Transformer and 2RS Transformer were in progress at the time of the event. A portion of the new raceway was under construction. The cables were replaced entirely employing a route designed to avoid cable submergence in water. Subsequent to installation  cables were successfully tested and returned to service.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
"On June 5, 2018, the Unit 1 ""B"" Reactor Steam Dome Pressure - Low permissive pressure switch Microswitch 2 (SW2) was found outside of the Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.5.1 allowable value during testing. Subsequently, on June 6, 2018, the Unit 2 ""C"" Reactor Steam Dome Pressure - Low permissive pressure switch SW2 was found outside of the TS 3.3.5.1 allowable value during testing. Both drifted outside of the lower allowable value which is intended to ensure that the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) injection prevents the fuel peak cladding temperature from exceeding the limits. Based on the information available, the condition existed for longer than allowed by Units 1 and 2, TS 3.3.5.1 and TS 3.5.1. As such, this is a condition prohibited by TS and is being reported. This is also considered a common cause inoperability of independent trains or channels, a condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function, and a single cause that could have prevented fulfillment of safety functions of trains or channels in different systems. The cause was determined to be instrument setpoint drift due to temperature/humidity changes and mechanical hysteresis as a result of the original design inputs.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ix)(A)']"
On August 22  2018  at 0943 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)  the Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 2 reactor automatically tripped while operating at 100 percent power when operators changed the turbine control system from Operator Auto to Turbine Manual. All control and shutdown bank rods inserted properly in response to the reactor trip. All safety systems including the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System actuated as expected. The reactor automatically tripped with a follow-on turbine trip in response to throttle valve closure. Throttle valve closure was caused by a turbine control system throttle valve manual up/down (U/D) counter card failure. The card failure resulted in the closure of throttle valves which caused an initiation of a reactor trip with a follow-on turbine trip. Initial corrective actions included replacing the failed card. The main turbine analog electro-hydraulic (AEH) control system is scheduled to be replaced with a modern fault tolerant digital turbine control system. Installation is scheduled for the Unit 2 Cycle 2 refueling outage in April 2019. This event is being reported as an automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and the AFW system.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On July 7  2011 a reportable condition was determined to have existed at Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant. On March 11  2009 during scheduled testing at an offsite testing facility the as- found lift setting for pressurizer safety valve serial number BS03213 was measured higher than the Technical Specification allowable value. However test results were submitted to Calvert Cliffs stating that the as-found test was successful. The valve had been installed in Unit 2 at the 2RV201 location (Unit 2 pressurizer safety valve) and was removed during the 2009 Unit 2 refueling outage for scheduled testing and maintenance. No material conditions were found that contributed to the high setpoint discovered during the test. The apparent cause is a greater than expected setpoint variation. The currently installed valves are operable. The corrective action is to increase the Technical Specification setpoint tolerance. A similar event is documented in Licensee Event Report 317/2010-002. The cause for that event was setpoint variation.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On February 9, 2021, Reactor Building differential pressure (d/p) became unstable and exceeded the Technical Specifications limit of -0.25 inches of water gauge (wg) resulting in Secondary Containment being declared inoperable. Two causal factors were identified for this event. The first being that Reactor Building d/p controller 'A' has not been tuned to quickly respond to changing environmental conditions. The second factor is that there were no interim actions in place to bridge the gap identified in previous events. Reactor Building d/p controller 'A' was optimally tuned. Follow up troubleshooting showed the as-left settings of the controller would be capable of maintaining Reactor Building d/p within limits when exposed to similar barometric pressure fluctuations. There was no impact on nuclear safety, plant reliability, radiological safety, or industrial safety.

"On May 29, 2019 at 2210 hours, during Security Force on Force Practice Drills, both doors in the Secondary Containment (SC) air lock on the reactor building first floor were opened simultaneously for a period of approximately two seconds. During the drill exercise, the Controller failed to maintain the access control measures at the outer air lock door which resulted in additional drill personnel accessing through the door. The condition resulted in Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.4.1.3 not being met. The doors were secured immediately. SC pressure during that time remained unchanged and within TS limits. There were no radiological releases associated with this event.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']
"On July 1, 2020, the motor thermal overloads associated with the 2A Core Spray Room Cooler Fan were found tripped during a surveillance test. The breaker was not tripped and was found still in the ""on"" position. Operators reset the thermal overloads, which restarted the room cooler fans without resetting the breaker. The thermal overloads were replaced on July 2, 2020. After a recurrent trip on July 6, 2020, troubleshooting determined that mechanical binding within the motor sporadically increased the running current, which tripped the thermal overloads. An engineering evaluation later determined that the non-functional Core Spray Room Cooler Fan rendered the Loop I Core Spray subsystem inoperable from May 29, 2020 until July 12, 2020, which is longer than allowed by Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.1, ""Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) -- Operating"". On June 13, 2020 a planned surveillance rendered the Loop II Core Spray System inoperable. This resulted in a period of time with both Loops I and II of the Core Spray System concurrently inoperable resulting in a Safety System Functional Failure (SSFF) of systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. As a corrective action, the motor, thermal overloads, temperature switch, and starter coil were replaced. As a corrective action to prevent recurrence, BFN is creating a new Preventative Maintenance (PM) to measure the motor current readings to the thermal overloads every two years, during the summer months when the fan is in high use. This will detect possible changes in continuous running current prior to overcurrent trips or motor damage.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
On January 6  2014  the 33 Steam Generator (SG) steam flow (SF) Feedwater flow (FF) mismatch and SG level control deviation alarms annuniciated. Operators noticed the selected feedwater (FW) flow (FF) channel at zero and swapped to the alternate channel and noted both FW flow channels at zero. With the 33 SG level at approximately 10% and lowering  operators started actions to initiate a manual reactor trip (RT) when an automatic RT occurred on a SF/FF mismatch coincident with low 33 SG level. All control rods fully inserted and all required safety systems functioned properly with the exception of the intermediate range excore neutron flux detector N-35 which was undercompensated. The plant was stabilized in hot standby with decay heat being removed by the main condenser {SG}. The Auxiliary Feedwater System automatically started as expected due to SG low level from shrink effect. The Emergency Diesel Generators did not start as offsite power remained available and stable. Investigations determined the decreasing SG levels was due to reduced main FW flow as a result of a closed 33 Feedwater Regulating Valve (FRV). The closure of the 33 FRV-437 was due to no output from flow controller FC-437. The apparent cause was station personnel failed to apply lateral thinking and teamwork and question what other options were available besides procuring an identical controller. Corrective actions included replacing FC-437 and FC- 417. A project to improve procurement and ease replacement of NUS modules will be developed. The event had no effect on public health and safety.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On September 7, 2012, Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.7 Condition A was entered for an inoperable 22 Static Inverter (SI) after the 22 SI swapped to its alternate power source. Troubleshooting determined the SI frequency meter optical sensor light was out. Tapping on the meter resulted in the frequency meter light illuminating, allowing SI to sense that the correct frequency was present. After testing, operations transferred the 22 SI back to its normal power supply and exited TS 3.8.7. On September 10, 2012, operability of the 22 SI was questioned concerning the 22 SI seismic qualification. Because the cause of the failure of the frequency meter could not be determined, operations concluded there was no reasonable assurance that the 22 SI would be able to maintain its design function in the event of a seismic event and the 22 SI was declared inoperable. TS 3.8.7 was entered, the meter was replaced, and the 22 SI returned to its normal power supply. The apparent cause was inadequate use of human performance (HP) tools. Shift management did not effectively use questioning attitude. The Operations team level of knowledge on the operation of the optical sensor was insufficient to assess the seismic effect on its operation. Corrective actions included replacement of the 22 SI frequency meter, inclusion of event in operations training, and update of vendor manual on meter function. The System Description for electrical systems will be revised to include a discussion of SI frequency meter optical sensor, a Temp Mod had been installed for the 24 SI and was issued for the 21-23 SIs to bypass the out of frequency transfer. A mod will be prepared to replace the meters with a model that does not include transfer on out of frequency. An equipment failure analysis will be performed to determine the cause of the failure of the 22 SI frequency meter photocell LED.

"On May 17  2018  at 11:15 Central Daylight Time (CDT)  with Unit 2 in Mode 1 at 100% power  the station experienced an auto-start of Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG)  D5. The Bus 25 Potential Transformer fuse drawer was opened by a supplemental worker  causing Breaker 25-16 to open and de-energize Bus 25. Operators were able to manually close the EDG D5 output breaker to re- energize Bus 25. All equipment functioned as designed. EDG D5 was restored to a normal condition on May 17  2018  at 16:44. The Root Cause for this event was that Prairie Island Open Phase Project was inadequately challenged to recognize and understand the risk associated with transitioning work activities from the 2R30 Outage to the Online schedule. Corrective Actions  include Revising the ""Online Scheduling Procedure"" to include a requirement for a challenge board to be held for Outage to Online decisions involving Modifications. Labeling PT drawers with equipment ID and locking device and caution to instruct operator approval prior to opening drawer and contain a physical barrier such as a lock or zip tie to discourage opening.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On April 7  2016 at 0638 hours  with Surry Power Station Units 1 and 2 operating at 100% power  the Emergency Service Water Pump (ESWP) 1B cooling water discharge valve flange was found to be cracked  and the pump was declared inoperable. During flange and valve support repair activities  four bolts on the cooling water discharge valve support base plate were found to be failed due to corrosion. The flange was replaced and the support base plates were anchored with stainless steel bolts. ESWP 1B was returned to operable status on April 9  2016 at 1105 hours. The cause of the flange and support failure was corrosion of the base plate and anchor bolts from repetitive exposure to service water. On May 11  2016  an Engineering evaluation determined that the piping and support had been non-functional for prior operability based on the potential for lateral displacement during a seismic event. Therefore  this report is being submitted for operations prohibited by Technical Specifications  and an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to remove residual heat. Based on the risk assessment of this event  the risk impact was determined to be of very low significance  and  as a result  the health and safety of the public were not affected.,"['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B)']"
"On September 26, 2022, operators at the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station performed quarterly stroke time testing of Unit 2 Emergency Service Water (ESW) to Turbine Building Closed Cooling Water and ESW to Reactor Building Closed Cooling Water isolation valves. Performance of this surveillance results in the inoperability of Unit 2 Division 2 of the Core Spray system. This surveillance was performed while Unit 2 Division 1 of the Core Spray system was out of service for planned maintenance, resulting in both divisions of the Core Spray system being inoperable and a loss of safety function. The condition was identified during the subsequent shift while performing routine review of operator logs. The cause of the event was determined to be inadequate performance of a loss of safety function determination, which failed to identify a loss of safety function resulting from concurrent inoperability of both divisions of Core Spray.

The main generator excitation system experienced a failure which tripped the Main Generator which subsequently tripped the Turbine and Reactor. The Reactor Trip System, the Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System, and other responding equipment performed as expected. The plant was stabilized in Mode 3. The cause of the event was a failure of the Main Generator excitation system. The safety significance of this event is very low.

"While Unit 2 was in a refueling outage on April 1  2014  manual ultrasonic (UT) examinations identified indications on Safety Injection (NI) system piping. On April 3  2014  phased-array UT techniques confirmed one indication as a rejectable flaw. Because the flaw was rejectable under American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code requirements  it is reportable as a degraded condition. Stress analysis showed that the crack would not have prevented the piping from performing its safety function, so this event did not impact public health and safety. The preliminary cause of the flaw is a legacy issue of previous leakage past valve 2NI-3 (Unit 2 Cold Leg Injection Isolation) creating a high frequency thermal cycle condition. This condition initiated the fatigue crack identified during the UT examination. Additionally  this flaw was missed during the previous refueling outage as a result of a probable skill-based human performance error. Actions were taken to repair the NI piping on Unit 2 and to re-inspect other susceptible lines before the unit restarted from its refueling outage. Based on an extent of condition evaluation, a reasonable assurance of operability exists for similar Unit 1 configurations. The LER will be supplemented upon finalization of the cause analysis.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A)']

At 0913 hours while performing inspections during the MODE 3 descending walkdown, a through-weld leak was identified on the steam generator (SG) 1B channelhead drain line at the drain isolation valve weld. The cause of the condition was high cycle fatigue that initiated from a small weld defect at the root of the socket fillet weld. Corrective actions included the removal of the weld defect and the drain valve and installing a cap on the SG channelhead drain line 1B.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
On Friday February 8  2013  at 2117 hours with the reactor initially at 85% core thermal power  Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station (PNPS) experienced a loss of off-site power (LOOP) resulting in a load reject and a reactor scram. All rods fully inserted and the Emergency Diesel Generators automatically started and powered safety-related buses A5 and A6. All other safety systems functioned as required. The plant stabilized in Hot Shutdown. At the time of the event a significant winter storm (Nemo) was buffeting Southern New England. At 2200 hours PNPS in conjunction with the local grid operator determined off-site power sources were not reliable and efforts to restore off-site power were temporarily suspended. At 2200 hours  PNPS declared a Notification of Unusual Event. On February 10  at 1055 hours  one of two off-site power supplies was restored  all safety buses were powered from the startup transformer and the Unusual Event was exited. Later on February 10  at 1402 hours with the plant in Cold Shutdown  ice bridging on a startup transformer insulator caused its 345 KV supply breaker to open resulting in a second LOOP. Again the EDG's started and powered safety-related buses. All other safety systems functioned as required. Shutdown cooling was restored at 1426 hours. On February 10  at 2020 hours  this occurrence was reported to the USNRC as documented in EN# 48739. The severe winter storm which caused extensive generalized geographical damage to the electrical distribution network was root cause of the LOOP events. These events posed no threat to public health and safety.,"['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B)']"
On 1/1/2019 while performing planned maintenance on the Feedwater Distributed Control System (FW DCS) at 5 percent power it was discovered that the automatic trip instrumentation of the Gland Seal Exhauster (GSE) was inoperable. The automatic GSE trip function is a documented assumption in the safety analysis for the Control Rod Drop Accident and is required by Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.7.3 when reactor thermal power is less than or equal to 10 percent. The automatic trip function of the GSE was inoperable for 1 minute 19 seconds. The impact on the GSE trip function during implementation of the site procedures and the applicable work order was inadequately documented prior to starting the planned maintenance on the FW DCS. There was no adverse impact to public health and safety or to plant employees and there were no radiological releases. The cause of the GSE trip inoperability resulted from inadequate procedural guidance during planned maintenance on the FW DCS. GSE trip operability was restored automatically by FW DCS without any required actions. Site procedures were revised on or before January 11 2019 to describe the impact of the FW DCS on the GSE trip and reference the applicable TS.,"['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
Unit 1 reactor enclosure secondary containment integrity was briefly declared inoperable when both doors on a reactor enclosure 201' elevation pipe tunnel airlock were simultaneously opened. The cause of the event was a degraded closing mechanism on the airlock inboard door. The airlock doors were closed to restore reactor enclosure secondary containment integrity. The degraded inboard door closing mechanism was repaired.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']
"On April 22 2019 at 0850 hours, the non-safety related Start Up Feedwater (SUFW) pump [SJ] was started in support of plant heat up per Byron procedure 2BGP 100-1, ""Plant Heatup"". Engineering was performing monitoring and identified that the inboard motor bearing temperature of the SUFW pump was elevated and continuing to rise. Operations was notified and continued to monitor the bearing temperature in parallel with Engineering monitoring. At 1300 hours, the bearing reached 208 degrees F and the SUFW pump was secured to prevent damage to the motor. During this time, Operations was not able to begin the startup process for the non-safety related Motor Driven Feedwater (MDFW) pump because it was not filled and vented. Therefore, upon securing the SUFW pump, Operations entered Byron procedure 2BOA SEC-1, ""Secondary Pump Trip"" and performed the appropriate attachment for loss of Feedwater flow in Mode 3. The attachment required Operations to start an Auxiliary Feedwater (AF) [BA] pump. The motor driven AF pump [AFW Train A] was manually started at 1323 hours on April 22 2019 and supplied water to the Steam Generators as designed. This resulted in ENS 54020 for manual actuation of the AF system. Filling and venting of the MDFW pump were completed and the pump was started at 1626 hours, allowing the motor driven AF pump to be shut down at 1632 hours on April 22 2019.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On December 15, 2016 the Unit 3 train B (3B) diesel generator (DG) experienced a failure during the performance of a monthly surveillance test. At 0356 Mountain Standard Time a master connecting rod mechanically failed and caused significant damage to the 3B DG. Unit 3 control room staff declared the 3B DG inoperable and entered Technical Specification Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.8.1 AC Sources - Operating Condition B. To support repairs, Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (PVNGS) received two license amendments to extend the LCO 3.8.1 Condition B required action completion time for the 3B DG from 10 days to 62 days. The root cause analysis determined the 3B DG master connecting rod failed due to high cycle fatigue caused by misalignment of the crankshaft bore introduced by a previous failure that occurred in 1986. The failure mechanisms that caused the 1986 and 2016 3B DG failures are not present in any other PVNGS DG. As a corrective action, the crankshaft was removed from the 3B DG and alignment was restored to within manufacturer specifications. All damaged components were replaced or repaired, testing was completed, and the 3B DG was declared operable on February 10, 2017. As an additional corrective action, PVNGS will perform more frequent testing on DG master rods to ensure effective identification of fatigue cracks prior to failure. PVNGS will also perform master rod bearing clearance and master rod stud preload checks.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
"On April 8, 2023 at approximately 2144 MST, following a turbine trip due to the loss of control oil header pressure, both 13.8 kV non-class buses de-energized, which caused a loss of power to the Reactor Coolant Pumps and resulted in a reactor trip. The B auxiliary feedwater pump was started to feed both steam generators due to the de-energization also having led to the main feed pumps tripping on low suction pressure. A Main Steam Isolation Signal was manually actuated due to a loss of circulating water flow to the condenser, which isolated the main steam header and required the use of Atmospheric Dump Valves for heat removal. The cause of the reactor trip was the result of the turbine generator primary and backup reverse power relays failing to actuate due to not reaching the trip setpoint timing. There was high reactive load on the system grid. This resulted in the reverse power relays not actuating. Corrective actions include enhancement of the excitation system, modification of the existing fast bus transfer logic upon a turbine trip, and a design change to replace the electro-mechanical reverse power relays with microprocessor-based relay equivalents for the main generator in all three units.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']

"On September 29, 2016, at Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1 (ANO-1), during refueling outage 1R26 with both trains of Decay Heat Removal (DHR) in service, a 0.125 gpm leak was identified in the DHR system at a one-inch drain line. This leak was on a section of cross-connect piping shared by both trains of the DHR system. The consequence of the leak was that both trains of the DHR system were declared inoperable. The leakage was due to a fatigue crack caused by vibration of the drain line due to a pipe support that was not designed for system vibration. Other systems and components in ANO-1 and ANO, Unit 2 (ANO-2) exposed to elevated system vibration were evaluated with respect to this condition. As a result of this evaluation, socket welds on other drains and vents in the ANO-1 DHR system were cut out and replaced, and pipe supports were modified where needed to withstand system vibration.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
On January 3  2013  at 19:32 PST  with Units 1 and 2 in Mode 1 and at 100 percent power  Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) determined that the Limiting Condition for Operation of Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.12  low temperature overpressure protection system  was not met during Unit 1 and Unit 2 refueling outages over the past 3 years. Specifically  when TS 3.4.12 was applicable  DCPP operated with more than one centrifugal charging pump (CCP) capable of injecting into the reactor coolant system. The noncompliance was identified based on a Nuclear Regulatory Commission TS Interpretation letter dated January 3  2013  to Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Company. DCPP concluded that it had not complied with TS 3.4.12 since it replaced the positive displacement pump (PDP) with a CCP in Unit 1 (2005) and in Unit 2 (2007). Immediate corrective actions in response to this event included revising the affected procedures to ensure compliance with TS 3.4.12. The apparent cause for this event includes a deficiency in DCPP's procedure and human error. The procedure did not provide guidance regarding proposed design changes that may maintain the original intent but create new literal compliance issues. The human error occurred when DCPP staff interpreted the operability requirements outlined in TS 3.4.12 as being equivalent with respect to the PDP to CCP design change. Corrective actions included revising the associated procedure  revising the Current Licensing Basis Determination Procedure and providing a lessons-learned discussion to the staff. This event did not adversely affect the health and safety of the public.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']

The SRV was declared inoperable due to criteria specified in a Pilgrim plant procedure. Specifically, the SRV is inoperable if the pilot stage thermocouple temperature is 35° F below its baseline temperature. The safety relief valve was declared inoperable and the Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) for Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.D was entered. Due to the valve being declared inoperable, the station was required to be shutdown and reactor coolant pressure be below 104 psig within 24 hours per T.S. 3.6.D.2.

"On December 9, 2013, at approximately 0747 CST, Arkansas Nuclear One Unit 2 (ANO-2) experienced an electrical fault on the Unit Auxiliary Transformer (2X-02) buses resulting in a fire and catastrophic failure of the transformer. This caused an automatic reactor and main turbine trip, lockout of the Switchyard Auto Transformer, lockout of ANO-2 Startup 3 Transformer (2X-03), and loss of power to Arkansas Nuclear One Unit 1 (ANO-1) Startup 1 Transformer (X-03). The switchyard auto transformer supplies one of the two credited offsite sources supplying both Startup 3 Transformer (2X-03) and Arkansas Nuclear One Unit 1 (ANO-1) Startup 1 Transformer (X-03). A loss of one of the two available offsite power sources for ANO-2 resulted in an auto-start of the ANO-2 Emergency Diesel Generator (2K-4B) to supply ANO-2 safety bus 2A-4 and initiation of the Emergency Feedwater (EFW) System. Investigations determined the most probable cause of the event that led to failure of the Unit Auxiliary Transformer began with a phase-to-ground fault on the 6900V 'C' phase non-segregated bus flexible link for 2X-02. Transformer 2X-02 protective relays designed to isolate the bus from an electrical fault actuated, but due to a disconnected lead, the Main Generator Lockout relays failed to actuate leading to 2X-02 failure. A root cause evaluation determined a flexible link for 2X-02 was not properly installed which led to an insulation breakdown at the bolted connection. The subsequent 2X-02 explosion and fire resulted from a non-landed wire due to a human performance error most likely occurring in 1995 that failed to connect the DC conductor to the output contacts for the protective relays.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On December 21  2012  at 0527 hours  Salem Unit 1 was in Mode 1 operating at 100% rated thermal power when it experienced an automatic reactor trip due to a turbine trip. The turbine trip was the result of a Main Generator trip due to a Main Power Transformer overexcitation signal. An automatic start of the Auxiliary Feedwater system occurred as expected on unit trip due to low Steam Generator water levels. The unit was stabilized in Mode 3  Hot Standby conditions and operators transitioned to normal operating procedures at 0621 hours. The cause of this event is attributed to setpoint drift of the Main Power Transformer General Electric type STV Overexcitation trip relay.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"The non-essential Service Water (SW) automatic isolation function ensures adequate intake canal inventory can be maintained by the emergency service water pumps following a design basis accident. This is accomplished using intake canal level probes which will isolate the non-essential equipment once the canal level drops below a predetermined level. On 3/22/2022 during routine testing 2 of the 4 probes failed their response time test. The probes were cleaned, retested satisfactory, and returned to service. The cause of the test failure was determined to be biofouling. There were no safety consequences since an engineering analysis concluded that the intake canal level and inventory would have been sufficient to support all accident analysis assumptions. Planned corrective actions include increased testing to monitor the biofouling buildup and the continued testing of probe coatings to reduce the biofouling.

"On May 10, 2011, during routine auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pump Technical Specification (TS) testing, the turbine-driven AFW pump, P-8B, tripped due to the unexpected actuation of the mechanical overspeed trip linkage. Examinations revealed that the knife-edge of the trip resetting lever had disengaged from the hand trip lever latch area allowing the trip valve assembly to isolate steam flow to the turbine-driver. The initial causal evaluation determined supplemental contract employees had inappropriately applied grease to knife-edge area on the mechanical overspeed trip linkage during maintenance activities performed in the October 2010 refueling outage. Therefore, P-8B and its corresponding AFW train were considered inoperable for a period of time longer than the 72 hours allowed by TS 3.7.5.A. Based on the information available at that time, greasing of the knife-edge area on the mechanical overspeed trip linkage was considered to be the sole cause of the P-8B trip. Subsequent discussions with the turbine vendor revealed other possible causes for the trip. In addition, an independent analysis determined that the greasing alone would not account for the overspeed trip of the pump turbine. As a result, additional investigations were completed. The outcome of the investigations did not identify any single physical cause for the pump trip. However, several other potential causes were identified. All the identified potential causes for the overspeed trip were addressed to ensure overspeed trip reliability. Planned corrective actions include a revision to the applicable maintenance procedure to incorporate vendor recommendations, process enhancements in the identification of critical maintenance activities and ensuring appropriate oversight of supplemental workers performing critical maintenance activities.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On April 24, 2020 during the Beaver Valley Power Station, Unit No. 2 (BVPS-2) twenty-first refueling outage (2R21), the results of ultrasonic examinations performed on Penetration 37 of the reactor vessel head did not meet the applicable acceptance criteria. The indication was not through wall and there was no evidence of leakage at this penetration based on inspections performed on top of the reactor vessel head. Because this indication could not be dispositioned as acceptable per American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code Section XI in a Reactor Coolant System pressure boundary, it was reported per Event Notification 54680 as a degraded condition. Primary Water Stress Corrosion Cracking (PWSCC) of the Alloy 600 penetration tube material was determined to be the cause of the identified flaw. Reactor vessel head Penetration 37 was repaired in accordance with the applicable embedded flaw repair methodology approved by the NRC for use at BVPS-2. A weld overlay of PWSCC resistant material was performed to isolate the indication from the borated water. The safety significance of this indication was very low.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A)']
"On November 24, 2015 at 0534 hours, the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant was at 0% power in Mode 3 (Hot Shutdown) for a forced outage. While initially placing Shutdown Cooling (SDC) in service, the 12 Residual Heat Removal (RHR) pump tripped approximately 8-10 seconds after start due to the closure of the RHR SDC suction isolation valves. When placing SDC in service, flow rapidly increased after opening the RHR Division 2 Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) outboard injection valve causing a localized pressure transient in the reactor recirculation pump suction piping that resulted in an isolation of the SDC suction line. Reactor pressure vessel (RPV) pressure remained stable at approximately 30 psig. Prior to attempting to place 'B' SDC in service, the Condensate system and the 'F' Safety Relieve Valve were in service providing decay heat removal. Immediate actions were taken to restore 'B' RHR SDC to operable status, thus an alternative method of decay heat removal was already established by the Condensate system and 'F' Safety Relief Valve.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B)']
On November 3  2017  at 2022 hours  with reactor power at 100 percent  Indian Point Unit 3 experienced an automatic reactor trip on a turbine trip  which was in response to a main generator trip. The main generator trip was initiated by actuation of the Generator Protection System due to a main generator loss of field. All control rods fully inserted and all required safety systems functioned properly. The plant was stabilized in hot standby with decay heat being removed by the main condenser. The Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFWS) automatically started as expected on steam generator low level to provide feedwater flow to the steam generators. The plant was stabilized in hot standby with decay heat being removed by the main condenser. The direct cause of the loss of main generator field was a failed Thyristor Firing Module drawer which affected proper operation of the redundant Thyristor Firing Module drawer. The root cause was determined to be that the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) Firing Module power supplies have a latent design vulnerability where shared common output nodes are not isolated after a failure. A plant modification is proposed that will eliminate the condition by electrically isolating the AVR Firing Module power supplies upon failure. This event had no effect on the public health and safety. The event was reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on November 3  2017.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On August 23, 2017, Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) identified that procedures 1-E-1 and 2-E-1 Loss of Reactor or Secondary Coolant contained steps to manually open 1-FCV-67-458 in the event of a Train A or B power failure. Opening 1-FCV-67-458 would result in the crosstie of Essential Raw Cooling Water (ERCW) Headers 2A and 1B which would lead to providing flow to equipment not operating due to the loss of a train of power. On October 6, 2017, it was determined that for certain time periods, if a design basis accident had occurred on Unit 2 with a loss of offsite power concurrent with a train failure and with 1-FCV-67-458 opened, inadequate ERCW flow would have been available to remove decay heat after transfer to cold leg recirculation. This condition only affected operability of ERCW Train A. This is reportable as a condition prohibited by Technical Specification 3.7.8. The issue associated with this incorrect procedural step to cross-tie the ERCW trains in 1-E-1 and 2-E-1 was addressed as part of actions to resolve an ERCW design and procedure issue documented in Licensee Event Report (LER) 390-2017-009. This report, while related, identifies an issue that was not addressed in the prior LER.

This constituted a condition that could potentially prevent fulfillment of the safety function of onsite AC power sources and decay heat removal. The Division 2 residual heat removal loop was operating in shutdown cooling satisfactorily maintaining reactor coolant temperature. The cause of the event is that station personnel failed to recognize the breakers' vulnerability to this failure mode. This directly resulted in the failure to take corrective action prior to this industry notification.

Subsequent to the reactor trip, the auxiliary feedwater system actuated as expected on low steam generator level. There were no other equipment performance issues. The cause of this event is attributed to pre-existing flaws with reactor trip breaker cubicle design that allowed for the flexing of the cell switch support structure, which resulted in the failure of the cell switch to change state and preclude a turbine trip or reactor trip when the 'B' reactor trip bypass breaker was racked in to position during testing.

On December 1  2013  at 06:13 EST  Hope Creek Unit 1 automatically scrammed from 100 percent rated thermal power due to a main turbine trip. The main turbine trip was due to high level in the 'A' moisture separator (MS). As a result of the scram  both reactor recirculation pumps tripped and three safety relief valves opened. The plant was stabilized in hot shutdown Operational Condition 3. The MS normal level controller failed due to a ruptured bellows causing the MS drain valves to close. The MS dump valve controller attempted to maintain MS level and cycled the dump valve as required. After multiple cycles  the dump valve failed in the closed position. This caused the MS level to increase above the main turbine trip setpoint  resulting in the main turbine trip and the subsequent automatic reactor scram. A root cause evaluation determined the cause of the MS dump valve failure was thermal binding. The MS drain and dump valve controllers were replaced  calibrated  and functionally tested. The root cause evaluation performed after a second scram on high MS level on December 5  2013  determined that the MS dump valve clearances need to be modified to prevent thermal binding.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']

The plant Technical Specifications (TS) require that Secondary Containment vacuum be maintained greater than or equal to -0.125 inches of water gauge. As a result of the RBHVAC trip, this specification was not maintained for approximately 4 seconds until the safety-related Standby Gas Treatment (SGT) system restored Secondary Containment vacuum to an acceptable value. At 0450 EST, during restoration activities, Secondary Containment vacuum again degraded to less than -0.125 inches of water gauge for 38 seconds until restored by the SGT system. RBHVAC was restored by resetting the freeze protection feature and the SGT system was returned to a standby condition. In both instances, the lowest observed vacuum was -0.11 inches of water gauge. There were no radiological releases associated with this event. The cause of the freeze protection actuation was insufficient heat transfer from the heating coil associated with 1 of the 14 freeze protection actuators. An investigation revealed that this particular heating coil, installed in 2011, has material properties that differ from the original design specification. This results in a reduced heat transfer rate. The heating coil is scheduled to be replaced before the next winter season.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']
On April 19  2018  at 2100 hours  during initial plant startup following the Spring 2018 refueling outage (2R23)  Indian Point Unit 2 commenced performance of the main turbine generator startup procedure to conduct turbine overspeed testing. At 2107 hours  the control room received main feedwater supervisory and panel alarms  and the main turbine control valves were observed to have opened rapidly. The unexpected rapid opening of the turbine control valves caused steam flow to increase  which in turn  caused all four steam generator water levels to swell. The high steam generator levels initiated an automatic main feedwater isolation and main turbine trip  with both Main Boiler Feedwater Pumps (MBFPs) tripping on closure of their discharge valves as part of the main feedwater isolation actuation. At 2108 hours  with reactor power at 8 percent and no MBFPs running  a manual reactor trip was inserted by the control board operators in accordance with the abnormal operating procedure for loss of main feedwater. All control rods fully inserted and all required safety systems functioned properly. The plant was stabilized in hot standby with decay heat being removed by the main condenser. The Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFWS) automatically started as expected on the tripping of the MBFPs to maintain steam generator inventory. The direct cause of the event was main turbine control oil stop valve LO-Z being out of its required position (closed instead of open). The root cause was main turbine generator startup procedure (2-SOP-26.4) provided a weak barrier to maintain the proper configuration of the main turbine control oil system. Corrective actions primarily involved the resolution of configuration control and management vulnerabilities. This event had no effect on the public health and safety.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On March 14, 2016 Watts Bar Nuclear Plant (WBN) Unit 1 determined through engineering analysis that both trains of emergency gas treatment system (EGTS) were inoperable for 8 minutes, 10 seconds during preoperational testing of Unit 2 EGTS. The inoperability of A and B trains of Unit 1 EGTS took place on October 22, 2015, while Unit 1 was in Mode 1 and two trains of EGTS were required to be operable in accordance with technical specification (TS) limiting condition for operation (LCO) 3.6.9, ""Emergency Gas Treatment System (EGTS)."" At the time of the event, Unit 2 was in ""no Mode"" prior to initial fuel loading. With both trains of EGTS inoperable, the specified safety functions of Unit 1 EGTS were not capable of being performed. Therefore, this condition is being reported pursuant to ""Event or Condition That Could Have Prevented Fulfilment of a Safety Function.""","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
On September 6  2016 at 0827 EDT  with the reactor at approximately 91 percent core thermal power  operators manually scrammed the reactor when the benchmark for a reactor water level of +42 inches increasing was reached. Following the scram  all rods fully inserted and the Average Power Range Monitors were downscale  indicating the reactor was shut down. The Main Steam Isolation Valves closed on a Primary Containment Isolation Signal Group 1 isolation and were subsequently reopened to maintain reactor pressure. The reason for the increasing reactor water level was the malfunction of Feedwater Regulating Valve 'A' (FRV 'A'). The reactor operator at the control panel placed FRV 'A' in remote manual in an attempt to stabilize the feedwater flow oscillations. This had no effect on the performance of FRV 'A'. The operators experienced feedwater flow oscillations from FRV 'A' that resulted in reactor water level high and low level alarms on the control panel. Shortly after this  the benchmark reactor water level of +42 inches increasing was reached and operators manually scrammed the reactor. There was no impact to public health and safety.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On November 3  2011  at 1550 PDT  operators determined that the Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) control room ventilation system (CRVS) had a design vulnerability whereby unfiltered air supplied to the control room could exceed the flowrates used in the licensing-basis analysis of design basis accident consequences. Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) discovered this vulnerability during performance of control room in-leakage testing required by Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement 3.7.10.5. At 2051 PDT on November 3  2011  PG&E made an 8-hour non-emergency report (NRC Event Notification 47414). PG&E determined that the control room pressurization system airflow could bypass the supply filter if no CRVS booster fan in the associated train was operating. This would allow as much as 800 SCFM of unfiltered air to be delivered to the control room following an accident that resulted in initiation of the CRVS pressurization mode. Operators would have corrected the condition within 30 minutes after initiation of an SI by manually selecting the train's redundant subtrain in accordance with actions specified in DCPP EOP E-0  App. E. PG&E had not previously included this 30 minutes of unfiltered air supply to the control room in the analysis of record. This design vulnerability could have potentially resulted in operator dose greater than analyzed. Plant staff verified that all components and redundant components in each ventilation train were OPERABLE  and established configuration controls to ensure operator dose would continue to meet regulatory limits. Human error on the part of a 1991 Technical Review Group to eliminate the design vulnerability was the apparent cause of this issue. PG&E will implement corrective actions to eliminate the design vulnerability.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B)']
On October 14  2012  Cooper Nuclear Station operations personnel were flushing the B loop of Residual Heat Removal (RHR) in accordance with the station procedure in preparation for the start of the shutdown cooling mode of operation. The radwaste discharge valve was slowly throttled open per station procedure. Due to existing reactor temperature and pressure  and the position of the radwaste discharge valve  flashing of the hot reactor coolant to steam occurred. The pressure perturbation isolated the RHR shutdown cooling loop. The RHR system was subsequently vented and the flush was re-performed successfully. The root cause was the station procedure provides insufficient guidance to avoid automatic closure of the isolation valves during shutdown cooling heatup and flush when the reactor temperature is higher than 212 degrees Fahrenheit. To prevent recurrence of this event  the station procedure will be revised so that the isolation of RHR is an expected effect that will occur during shutdown cooling heatup and flush  and provide more specific instructions concerning throttling time versus reactor vessel conditions.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B)']
"On January 15 2022 at 2320 Central Standard Time (CST) during a drywell entry for leak identification, BFN Engineering personnel discovered a through-wall piping leak on a test line upstream of the Residual Heat Removal and Shutdown Cooling test shut-off valve. This test line is classified as American Society of Mechanical Engineers Code Class 1 piping and constitutes part of the Unit 1 Reactor Coolant System pressure boundary. Operations personnel declared the Unit 1 Low Pressure Coolant Injection system (LPCI) Loop I inoperable and maintained Unit 1 in Mode 4 or 5 until the leak was repaired. On January 16 2022 at 0541 CST, an eight-hour Event Notification was made to the NRC. The test line was cut and capped pending permanent repairs and on January 20 2022 at 1520 CST, Unit 1 LPCI Loop I was declared operable. The root cause of this event was small bore piping which was not specifically analyzed for fatigue failure vulnerability due to operational or resonance vibration. The corrective action for this event is to implement Engineering Change Packages for all small bore piping with vulnerability to fatigue failure due to exceeding the endurance limit due to operational vibration.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A)']"
"On June 19  2017, during performance of surveillance 6.PC.207, the control switch for vacuum breaker PC-AOV-NRV21 was cycled open then closed. When the control switch was taken to close, the vacuum breaker failed to indicate closed. Operations declared Primary Containment (PC) and PC-AOV-NRV21 inoperable. In addition, PC-AOV-NRV21 still indicated intermediate. The control switch for PC-AOV-NRV21 was cycled open and then closed a second time. At this time, PC-AOV-NRV21 indicated closed. Operations declared PC and PC-AOV-NRV21 operable. Two potential causes were identified during troubleshooting activities. The first is increased internal friction in the valve air operator of the vacuum breaker could cause the operator to close too slowly and limit the ability to fully close. The second is the solenoid operated valve (SOV) could bleed vented air off slowly causing the vacuum breaker to not fully close. Both the valve air operator and the SOV were replaced during troubleshooting activities. There were no safety consequences associated with this condition.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']
On February 7  2014  while performing the monthly torus to drywell vacuum breaker check procedure  vacuum breaker valve AO-2382A did not indicate closed as expected. The valve was cycled several times per an alarm response procedure for an open torus to drywell vacuum breaker until it indicated closed. Analysis has shown the cause of the observed indication for vacuum breaker valve AO-2382A after cycling was inconsistent operation of the valve limit switches. Based on failure modes and effects analysis  the closed limit switches did not consistently indicate closed when the valve was  in fact  closed. Vacuum breaker valve AO-2382A  its limit switches  and close indication circuit will be inspected to confirm the results of the failure mode and effects analysis during the next refueling outage or an earlier opportunity  if available.,"['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
"On June 16, 2015, while Harris Nuclear Plant (HNP) was operating at 100% in mode 1, two doors between the Reactor Auxiliary Building (RAB) and Main Steam Tunnel (MST) were opened to support a maintenance activity. These doors are credited in the high energy line break (HELB) equipment qualification and internal flooding analyses for HNP; however, the opening of these doors is not addressed in these analyses. If a HELB occurred in the MST during a time in which these doors are open, the Essential Services Chilled Water system could become inoperable. The root cause of this event was determined to be that HNP Engineering failed to develop and implement control measures for hazard barriers credited for mitigating HELB events. Immediate corrective action was taken to close the doors and issue a Standing Instruction that prohibits these doors from being blocked open during modes 1 through 4. Corrective action is planned to develop and implement an engineering change that evaluates the required passive design features needed to support HELB analysis and overall licensing bases.

Emergency Feedwater (EFW) Actuation Signals (EFAS-1 and EFAS-2) were received due to low SG levels, which is an anticipated response to the reactor trip with the plant at or near full power. SG #1 received EFW system flow for a short period of time. The plant stabilized in Mode 3 with levels in both SG's restored to normal operating band with the Main Feedwater (MFW) system.

"On July 08, 2024, at 2125 EDT, with Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Unit 3 in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, the reactor was manually tripped due to a main feedwater pump (MFWP) minimum flow control valve (FCV) failing to an open position, followed by an automatic safeguards actuation due to rapid cooldown of the primary system. The unit was stabilized with decay heat removed through the passive residual heat removal heat exchanger. The cause of the event was an unexpected change in the MFWP minimum FCV from closed to fully open due to foreign material inside the valve positioner. The valve positioner was replaced and an initial extent of condition review performed. In addition, a design change was made to initiate an automatic rapid power reduction upon failure of a MFWP minimum FCV, which will reduce the impact on steam generator water levels and eliminate the associated need to trip the reactor.

The valves 1-LCV-3-156-A and 1-LCV-3-164-A failed open following removal of the backup nitrogen control system. Upon investigation, two essential air isolation valves 0-ISV-32-371 and 0-ISV-32-373, which are normally open to supply essential air from the Auxiliary Compressed Air System (ACAS) to motor driven AFW LCVs, were found closed. Valves 0-ISV-32-371 and 0-ISV-32-373 were immediately opened which restored essential air to 1-LCV-3-156-A and 1-LCV-3-164-A.

Upon control room notification of the uncontrolled movement of CV-0576, the operators placed the turbine controls in manual operation. However, CV-0576 proceeded to open and close independently of valve controls.

On June 26 2018 at 0902 eastern daylight time a flow switch electronic circuit board associated with the B-train Emergency Gas Treatment System (EGTS) Air Cleanup Subsystem relative humidity heaters was replaced due to the circuit board approaching the end of its environmentally qualified life. Following board replacement the flow switch was calibrated and the B-train of EGTS was returned to service in the standby condition. The post maintenance testing (PMT) did not require or recommend operability testing. On July 22 2018 Operations personnel performed a surveillance instruction for Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.10.1 and identified that the B-train relative humidity heaters did not energize as required by the SR.

As scheduled a spare valve was installed in its place during the 2018 refueling outage. The failed valve was disassembled and inspected at an offsite facility. The apparent cause of the PSV failure identified that the expanded contact area between the valve's bellow nose and disc, which was caused by the presence of a bulge in the bellows nose as a result of bellows stretch and compression, did not allow the disc to act normally which resulted in the valve lifting early.

"On 8/13/2013 at 1545 EDT Unit 2 was operating at 100 percent RTP when it was determined that inter-cable analyses for the safe shutdown analysis had not been done using the guidance of Reg Guide 1.189 and NEI 00-01. An initial analysis for some of the components in the high/low pressure interface systems was performed considering inter-cable shorts as a plausible vector in the Safe Shutdown Analysis. Vulnerabilities were subsequently identified during this circuit analysis in that postulated fire scenarios can cause two valves required for safe shutdown to open during power operation. At risk are Residual Heat Removal (RHR) valves with controls in Fire Area 2203 (Fire Zone 2203F) and Fire Area 0024. Specifically during a postulated fire scenario on the affected unit an inter-cable hot short could occur on the control cables for inboard RHR shutdown cooling isolation valves causing the valves to open while at rated power. In addition a spurious opening of outboard RHR shutdown cooling isolation valves could occur due to an intra-cable hot short on the control cables in the same postulated event. An intersystem Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) could then occur when the low pressure system piping is subjected to higher reactor pressures as a result of the postulated conditions. The cause of the event is attributed to ineffective monitoring and follow-up of regulatory activities involving inter-cable hot shorts in identifying the vulnerabilities associated with these RHR isolation valves.

On 11/14/2021 at 05:25 EST a manual reactor scram was inserted on Unit 2 from 79 percent power due to degrading Main Condenser (EIIS: SG) vacuum. The loss of vacuum occurred due to an isolation of the Offgas System (ElIS: WF) on high Steam Jet Air Ejector discharge pressure and high Jet Compressor suction pressure. The manual reactor scram occurred with no complications and plant systems responded as expected. Unit 3 was unaffected. The scram resulted in an automatic Primary Containment Isolation System (PCIS)(EIIS: JM) Group II/III isolation. Upon initial investigation it was identified that the valve positioner for the Jet Compressor Bypass Valve (EIIS: PCV) had a significant air leak which prevented the valve from closing. The root cause of the positioner failure was determined to be the use of low temperature soft parts in a high temperature environment. The soft parts within the failed positioner were replaced with higher-temperature rated components. Actions are in place to replace other low temperature soft parts within the Offgas System.

During the shutdown process and after the reactor was subcritical  the reactor protection system was actuated to insert the remaining withdrawn control rods. The cause of the RCS pressure boundary leakage is a combination of stress corrosion cracking and fatigue or corrosion fatigue. A new vent valve assembly was fabricated and installed on the reactor recirculation system B flow control valve. Inspection of other vent and drain valves with similar configuration on the reactor recirculation system found no deficiencies. Design configuration options to address the cause will be evaluated. The safety significance of this event is considered to be small.,"['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']"
"On November 30, 2022, Hope Creek Generating Station (HCGS) discovered an electrical jumper that was installed on October 5, 2022, and should have been removed on October 10, 2022. The cause is human performance error. The jumper bypassed isolation actuation instrumentation associated with residual heat removal (RHR) system shutdown cooling (SDC) mode isolation. Specifically, it rendered one channel of a two-channel interlock that protects the RHR system from over-pressurization inoperable. The interlock prevents opening SDC valves when reactor pressure is above 82.0 psig. HCGS did not take required action required by technical specifications (TS) for this condition before entering applicable operational conditions on October 28, 2022. Consequently, HCGS was in a condition prohibited by TS from October 28 to November 30, 2022. HCGS removed the jumper to restore operability of the interlock shortly after discovery and completed individual performance management.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On February 16, 2017, at 1320 EST with Unit 2 at 0 percent rated thermal power due to being in a refueling outage, maintenance electricians were sent to the field to perform a protective relay trip test for the 2D start-up transformer (SAT). During the test setup, the 2E 4160 VAC Emergency Bus was inadvertently and momentarily de-energized, causing the 2A Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) to autostart, secondary containment to isolate, and start of the standby gas treatment system. Subsequent investigations revealed that the cause of the event was due to a movement operated contact (MOC) switch adapter was not required to be installed on the 2D normal supply breaker in the 2E 4160 VAC bus. All systems responded appropriately. A review of the event determined that the MOC switch adapter was not required to be installed by the procedure but was instructed to be installed by supervision. Corrective actions were taken to cover supervisor roles and responsibilities and the need for all workers to follow plant standards for procedure use and adherence. All breaker procedures and protective relay test procedures were reviewed to determine if a MOC switch adapter needs to be installed. Continuing training will also be held to cover this event and its lessons learned.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On September 10, 2019, at approximately 1502 Central Daylight Time (CDT), a lightning strike caused a power surge which disabled signal repeaters between the Local Intelligence Units (LIUs) of some security doors and the monitoring stations at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN). At 1830 CDT, it was discovered that some of the oncoming night shift personnel could not access particular areas which required keycard access. An extent of condition check conducted at 1934 CDT determined that access to the 1A and 3A Electric Board Rooms, which contain remote shutdown panels and Fire Safe Shutdown (FSS) equipment, was prohibited for the night shift personnel. This condition impacted the ability of Operators to perform their required actions in FSS procedures within prescribed time limits if a fire had occurred. The event was caused by lightning strike, which created a power surge, resulting in a security equipment communications failure. Access was restored to all plant areas at 2106 CDT. The immediate corrective action was to have Security and Operations personnel reset the malfunctioning equipment. This cleared the error and allowed the LIUs of the affected security doors to receive roster updates. As a corrective action to reduce the probability of recurrence, Site Security created a constantly-activated, all-access emergency keycard as a contingency against future door LIU communication failures. SSI-16.1 ""Compensatory Measures"" is being revised to proceduralize the emergency keycard's use.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B)']

Technical Specification (TS) 5.5.12, 'Primary Containment Leakage Rate Testing Program,' establishes limits for Primary Containment leakage. Based upon the results of the LLRT, Dresden Unit 2 may not have met the limits for primary containment leakage during the last operating cycle as specified in TS 5.5.12.C. The cause of the failure was the inability to fully seat the valve disc in the seat assembly for testing. Corrective actions included replacing valve assemblies using the latest maintenance practices and installing larger test taps for improved testing.

"On December 14, 2013, at 15:03 PST, with Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 1 operating in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent power, engineers identified a vulnerability to extreme weather. A combination of sustained high winds over 60 miles per hour and ambient air temperatures exceeding 97ºF could reduce cooling capacity such that the emergency diesel generators would exceed design limits, contrary to the requirements of General Design Criteria (GDC) 2. Upon identification of this condition, shift orders were issued that require, when conditions warrant, the implementation of existing procedural guidance to open plant doors. This will allow additional air flow, shown to provide adequate emergency diesel generator cooling to support continuous operation of the Unit 1 emergency diesel generators. An apparent cause evaluation concluded that PG&E did not have a design process requirement in place to evaluate GDC-2 design criteria relative to SSC functional requirements other than for structural integrity issues. Plant procedures were revised to include this requirement and PG&E will issue a design change to permanently modify the plant to resolve the wind issue.

On July 20, 2016, Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station personnel identified via trending that XHX0001A Chiller Circuit 1 cooling capacity was limited to approximately 65 tons. Further troubleshooting identified that the condition was due to XVM16484A-VU failing open intermittently. The past operability review found that XHX0001A was unable to provide design basis heat load cooling capacity and therefore was considered non-functional. XVM16484A-VU was replaced and post maintenance testing was completed satisfactorily.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']

"On February 23, 2017, radiography results for the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN) Unit 2 Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) system stop check valve 2-HCV-071-0014 (71-14 valve) showed the valve to be in the fully open position. In this position, the valve was incapable of performing its design function as a Primary Containment Isolation Valve (PCIV). In order to isolate the affected primary containment penetration flowpath, the RCIC Steam Line Outboard Isolation Valve was closed and deactivated to secure flow through the adjacent PCIV check valve in the exhaust line in accordance with plant Technical Specifications (TS) Limiting Conditions for Operation (LCO) for Primary Containment Isolation. It is assumed in the Past Operability Evaluation (POE) that the 71-14 valve had been inoperable from April 2015 to February 2017, in violation of TS LCO 3.6.1.3. During this time period, another check valve (upstream of the 71-14 valve) remained capable of isolating the affected penetration. The 71-14 valve was repaired during the BFN Unit 2 Cycle 19 Refueling Outage which began on February 25, 2017. The cause of this condition was determined to be inadequate minimum allowable internal clearances for the 71-14 valve. The 71-14 valve internals were machined to minimum allowable material as an interim action to mitigate risks. The corrective action to prevent recurrence is to replace the 71-14 valve with a new valve design that is not susceptible to the same internal binding potential.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
On January 11  2018  at 1041 EST  a planned train swap of the Reactor Building Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (RBHVAC) system resulted in the Technical Specification (TS) for secondary containment (SC) pressure boundary not being met for less than one minute. The maximum secondary containment pressure recorded during that time was approximately 0.116 inches of vacuum water gauge. Secondary containment pressure was restored to within TS limits by starting Division 1 of the Standby Gas Treatment System (SGTS). There were no safety consequences or radiological releases associated with this event. The cause of this momentary loss of SC was determined to be the effect of the RBHVAC West Exhaust Fan Modulating Damper failing to fully open.

The compensatory actions credit operator presence in the plant for maintaining heightened awareness and taking action to minimize fire hazards. Compensatory actions are incorporated in pertinent operating procedures. The compensatory actions remain in effect. There have been no actual adverse safety consequences resulting from the reported condition.

On Thursday  January 10  2013 at 1534 hour [EST]  with the reactor at 100% core thermal power  both reactor recirculation pumps unexpectedly tripped and a manual reactor scram was inserted as required by station procedures. Following the reactor scram  all rods were verified to be fully inserted and the Primary Containment Isolation System Group Il (Reactor Building) and Group VI (Reactor Water Cleanup System) actuations occurred as designed due to the expected reactor water level shrink associated with the scram signal. All other plant systems responded as designed. The scram was uncomplicated and decay heat was released to the main condenser via the turbine by-pass valves. The cause of the two reactor recirculation pumps tripping was due to the inadvertent seal-in of a relay (pump trip interlock) in the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) Loop Select Logic circuitry within the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) System during surveillance testing. When the logic was reset at completion of testing  a normally open relay contact (which was inadvertently closed) interlocked with the recirculation pumps circuit  sent a trip signal to their drive motor breakers.

"On July 12, 2019, at approximately 1640 Central Daylight Time (CDT), the Unit 1 High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) system unexpectedly received a Group 4 Primary Containment Isolation System (PCIS) signal which closed the HPCI inboard and outboard steam supply valves. Operations personnel declared HPCI inoperable and entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.1 ""Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) - Operating"" Condition C. The causes of this event were that Electrical Maintenance personnel failed to follow EPI-0-075-RLY001 ""Functional Test of Pressure Suppression Chamber Head Tank Pump Suction Valve Interlock Relays"" as written by not verifying panel number or wire number and by failing to use a peer check as required; and that the workers failed to apply maintenance fundamentals and technical skills with appropriate rigor when using test equipment.

"While Unit 2 was in a refueling outage on April 1, 2014, manual ultrasonic (UT) examinations identified indications on Safety Injection (NI) system piping. On April 3, 2014, phased-array UT techniques confirmed one indication as a rejectable flaw. Because the flaw was rejectable under American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code requirements, it is reportable as a degraded condition. Stress analysis showed that the crack would not have prevented the piping from performing its safety function, so this event did not impact public health and safety. The cause of the flaw is a legacy issue of previous leakage past valve 2NI-3 (Unit 2 Cold Leg Injection Isolation) creating a high-frequency thermal cycle condition. This condition initiated the fatigue crack identified during the UT examination. Additionally, this flaw was missed during the previous refueling outage as a result of a probable skill-based human performance error. Actions were taken to repair the NI piping on Unit 2 and to re-inspect other susceptible lines before the unit restarted from its refueling outage. Based on an extent of condition evaluation, a reasonable assurance of operability exists for similar Unit 1 configurations. As part of planned corrective actions, 2NI-3 (and its Unit 1 equivalent) will be isolated from the safety injection line.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A)']
"On January 22  2013  at 0332 hours  the reactor protection system (RPS) automatically actuated due to a loss of feedwater flow to the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). There were no complications during the shutdown as all control rods fully inserted and pressure was maintained by normal means. The High Pressure Core Spray (HPCS) and the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) systems actuated based on a valid reactor water level initiation and injected to restore RPV water level. The cause of the event was failure of a balance-of-plant inverter/static transfer switch  which provides electrical power to the digital feedwater control system. A circuit card in the static transfer switch degraded  which affected operation of the inverter. The electrical loads serviced by the inverter/static transfer switch were placed on an alternate power source. This alignment will continue until permanent repairs are made which are currently scheduled for the next refueling outage. The safety significance of this event is considered to be small. This event is being reported as an event or condition that resulted in an automatic actuation of the RPS, HPCS, and RCIC systems, and Operational Requirements Manual section 7.6.2.1, which requires a Special Report submittal following an Emergency Core Cooling System actuation and injection into the reactor coolant system.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On June 24, 2016, at 1511 (CST), Clinton Power Station (CPS) was operating at 99 percent reactor power when the MCR received two Fuel Building (VF) trouble alarms. An unexpected damper closure resulted in Secondary Containment (SC) vacuum degrading, eventually exceeding the Technical Specification (TS) limit of 0.25 inch vacuum water gauge. TS Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.6.4.1 Secondary Containment Required Action A.1 and Emergency Operating Procedure (EOP) - 08 Secondary Containment Control were entered. At 1512, SC vacuum was restored within TS limits with the auto start of VF supply fan 1VF03CB and exhaust fan 1VF04CB. An initial investigation determined that the 'A' Exhaust Fan Isolation Damper 1VF11YA had failed to the closed position on loss of air due to failure of the associated air supply solenoid 1FSVVF005. The apparent cause of this event is the failure of the ASCO solenoid valve 1FSVVF005 due to a slightly deformed and worn core which resulted in sticking. The failed solenoid valve 1FSVVF005 was replaced and the VF system ventilation was restored. In addition, parts quality testing and preventative maintenance programs are being established to replace VF solenoid operated valves on a periodic basis.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']
"On February 14 2023 at 1103 Central Standard Time (CST), Arkansas Nuclear One Unit 1 (ANO-1) automatically tripped on Reactor Protection System (RPS) actuation due to a sensed loss of the 'B' and 'D' Reactor Coolant Pumps (RCPs). The cause of this event was a blown secondary 'C' phase Potential Transformer (PT) fuse on a 6900 volt AC bus which caused the underpower relays for RCPs 'B' and 'D' to be de-energized and RPS tripped the reactor. Prior to the plant trip, the RCP 'D' underpower relay had been replaced. Following the reactor trip, the RCP 'D' underpower relay was replaced again with a known good relay and the blown secondary PT fuse was replaced. Both were tested satisfactorily prior to plant startup on February 16 2023. There were no consequences to the general safety of the public, nuclear safety, industrial safety or radiological safety. No radiological releases occurred due to this event.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On June 29, 2020 with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent power and Unit 2 in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent power, McGuire determined that Revision 0 of calculation MCC-1223.15-01-0015, Containment Floor and Equipment Sumps Volume Calculation, contained non-conservative assumptions that would have prevented the containment floor and equipment (CFAE) sump level monitors from detecting and alarming on a one gallon per minute input within one hour. Revision 0 of calculation MCC-1223.15-01-0015 was approved for use on April 15, 1994. Discovery of the non-conservative assumptions in Revision 0 of calculation MCC-1223.15-01-0015 resulted in a condition prohibited by Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.15, Reactor Coolant System (RCS) Leakage Detection Instrumentation, since the CFAE Sump Monitors for both Units was determined to be inoperable for longer than allowed by the TS 3.4.15 Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) action statements. No causal analysis was performed due to the legacy nature of Revision 0 of calculation MCC-1223.15-01-0015.

"At 19:30 on June 7, 2012, with Millstone Power Station Unit 2 (MPS2) operating at 100 percent power in Mode 1, it was determined that a series of gaps in a high energy line break (HELB) barrier rendered equipment in the west 480VAC switchgear room inoperable. The Shift Manager entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.2.1 Action, TS 3.8.2.1A Action ""c"" and TS 3.3.3.5 Action ""a"". The openings were sealed and the equipment restored to operable status at 16:05 on June 8, 2012. At the time of discovery, appropriate and timely actions were taken that met the TS action requirements. There is evidence that this condition has existed since initial construction. Since the HELB barrier required to maintain operability of bus 22E, Inverters 5 and 6, and remote shutdown panel C-21 was non-functional for an extended period of time, the Actions for TS 3.8.2.1, TS 3.8.2.1A, and TS 3.3.3.5 were historically not met. The apparent cause, dating back to original construction, is that no construction details were developed for sealing Q-decking when the ribbing is perpendicular to the top of the wall. As noted above, the gaps were subsequently sealed and an extent of condition inspection was conducted. Additional gaps in the same wall did not affect safety related equipment. No other gaps were identified. This report assumes the steam from a HELB in the turbine building would have affected the operability of safety related equipment in the west 480VAC switchgear room. More detailed, formal engineering analysis is being conducted to determine the extent of the actual safety impact. Therefore, a supplement to this LER will be submitted upon completion of that more detailed engineering analysis.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
On June 4 2018 at 0920 hours Braidwood Unit 1 was manually tripped due to lowering steam generator water levels following a trip of the 1C turbine driven feedwater pump. The 1A and 1B auxiliary feedwater (AF) pumps auto started as expected due to low steam generator levels. The cause of the event was due to the inclusion of a digital input module in the turbine driven feedwater pump control circuitry which affected only the safeguards testing function of the circuit and which was not identified as a design input per the design input and configuration change impact screening procedure. Corrective actions planned include implementing the changes to eliminate the design deficiency and revising the design input and configuration change impact screening procedure.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"At 11:42 on March 03, 2024, with Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant Unit 2 operating at 29 percent power, the Unit 2 Reactor automatically tripped due to a Turbine trip caused by a loss of suction to the 22 Main Feedwater (FW) Pump. The loss of 22 Main FW Pump led to an auto-start actuation of Auxiliary Feedwater. Operators responded to the event in accordance with approved procedures and safely placed the plant in Mode 3. All systems responded normally post trip. The cause of the event was CV-39140, Condensate Filter Demineralizer System Main Bypass Valve was not adequately designed to operate properly to control system differential pressures. As a result, insufficient flow was available to supply the 22 Main FW Pump. CV-39140 design is being changed to ensure that it will operate properly under all expected system differential pressures.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
Between October 21-28 2013 workers breached SQN Unit 1 containment penetration X-108 several times during fuel movement while performing plant maintenance. Technical Specification 3.9.4 Containment Building Penetrations requires that containment building penetrations providing direct access from the containment atmosphere to the outside atmosphere shall be closed during fuel movement. Workers were not aware that use of X-108 penetration was not allowed during movement of irradiated fuel. On October 27 2013 a Senior Reactor Operator identified penetration X-108 affecting the auxiliary building secondary containment enclosure (ABSCE) was breached without required compensatory measures. The penetration manual valves were subsequently closed and secured. The root cause is ineffective procedures for controlling containment penetration breaches during Modes 5 and 6.

Evaluation determined that the actual valve stoke time did not impact the functionality of the system. Investigation determined that the air supply valve to the 11SW535 had been replaced on May 11, 2016, and that the appropriate retest (stroke time testing of the 11SW535) had not been performed. This affected the operability of 11 and 12 Containment Fan Coil Units (CFCU) after both CFCU's had previously been declared operable. The 11 and 12 CFCU's were required to be operable upon entry into Mode 4 (while returning the unit to service from 1R24) on July 24, 2016 at 1009. Upon entry into Mode 4, the 13 CFCU was inoperable and had been tagged for maintenance. Inoperability of the 13 CFCU continued until July 28, 2016 at 0103.

"On April 30 2012 at 2328 hours during power ascension following a recent refueling outage, Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant (CNP) Unit 2 Reactor tripped automatically from a trip of the main turbine. All control rods fully inserted and the auxiliary feedwater system (AFW) started and performed as designed. On May 1 2012 at 0013 hours, the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIV) were closed and the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) temperature was controlled by the steam generator atmospheric relief valves (PORV). Closure of the MSIVs was based on cooldown of the RCS and recovered after closing the MSIVs. All major plant components functioned as designed with no safety system functional failures. The turbine trip was caused by the actuation of the main generator unit differential and overall differential lockout relays. The overall differential function of a multifunctional digital relay actuated and operated the lockout relays. The relay was installed during a recent refueling outage. The actuation was caused by an incorrect current transformer winding compensation setting within the relay. Action taken included correcting the relay setting.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On November 19, 2015, a review of Operations Logs determined that the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) Unit 2 Spent Fuel Pool (SFP) temperature had drifted approximately two degrees below the analyzed temperature of 68 degrees F on previous days. This was reported as an unanalyzed condition because the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) and the spent fuel analysis identified 68 degrees F as the lower temperature design basis for the SFP. SONGS Unit 2 and Unit 3 are permanently shutdown and defueled. Further review has identified additional incidents of SFP temperature drifting below 68 degrees F for both units since January 2013. The low temperature resulted from the decreasing residual heat load and cool ocean temperatures. The lower design basis SFP temperature provided in the UFSAR had not been translated into procedures or any other site document. The SONGS Units 2 and 3 spent fuel criticality calculation and UFSAR have been updated to establish a low temperature limit of 50 degrees F. The SFP procedure was revised to provide actions to secure all SFP Cooling Pumps prior to the pool temperature reaching 55 degrees F. This event did not affect facility operation or safety.

Three subsequent lifts were performed for the failed SRV pilot assemblies and the results were within the TS pressure setpoint tolerance. The cause of the failure was determined to be corrosion bonding. Although the setpoint lift pressures of the SRV pilot valve assemblies exceeded TS requirements, an analysis of the event concluded the thermal limits and American Society of Mechanical Engineers overpressure transients did not exceed allowable limits.

Gas Circuit Breaker Generator Output Breakers (GCBs) 4510 and 4514 tripped open to clear the fault. GCB 4510 failed to trip open properly, resulting in actuation of the GCB 4510 breaker failure protective relay, tripping open GCB 4506 and disconnecting the main generator from the grid. This resulted in a turbine trip and automatic reactor scram. The root cause of the failure of GCB 4510 to properly open, and subsequent trip open of GCB 4506, was due to corrosion of the GCB 4510 air system charging valve. Corrective actions taken and planned include: repairs to the 345 KV transmission line involved in the event, developing and implementing an improved Preventive Maintenance (PM) strategy for switchyard breakers, working with the switchyard operator to perform twelve-year breaker overhaul/replacement on affected GCBs/345 KV switchyard breakers, and providing training on effective design attribute review performance.

Investigation of this condition determined that the low flow rate was a result of previous maintenance performed on October 13, 2013, to replace an actuator linkage on the B-Train RHR heat exchanger discharge valve, Q1E11HCV603B. Analysis of the February 28, 2014, test results determined that the B-train RHR system flow rate was less than the minimum allowed by Technical Specifications, rendering the B-Train RHR system inoperable. Since this condition has existed for a time period in excess of the applicable Technical Specification Required Action Completion Time, this is a violation of Technical Specifications. Since the A-Train of RHR has been briefly inoperable during the period of B-Train RHR inoperability, this is also reportable. To correct the low flow condition, the full-open position of valve Q1E11HCV603B was adjusted to provide an acceptable flow rate.

"On December 24, 2020, at 1235 with the reactor at approximately 90% rated thermal power, a main generator fault occurred that led to a turbine trip and reactor trip. Safety systems functioned as required, including actuation of the auxiliary feedwater system and a main feedwater isolation due to a valid feedwater isolation signal. Operations staff responded to the event in accordance with applicable plant procedures. The post-trip investigation indicated that a fault internal to the main generator actuated the main generator protection system, which in turn caused the turbine trip and an automatic reactor trip since reactor power was above the P-9 setpoint. The cause of the generator fault was due to failure of the connection rings on the main generator stator. Both the collector end connection ring (i.e., phase ring) and the turbine end connection ring (i.e., serial ring) failed, resulting in an electrical path from the generator stator to ground. This electrical path resulted in a generator protection fault that was detected by the generator neutral ground overcurrent relay resulting in a generator trip and turbine trip.

"At approximately 2153 Mountain Standard Time on February 15, 2018, an automatic reactor trip of PVNGS Unit 1 occurred when two of four Reactor Coolant Pumps (RCPs) lost power and the Reactor Protection System (RPS) generated trips on all four channels for low departure from nucleate boiling ratio and high local power density following a main turbine generator trip. The two RCPs lost power due to the fast bus transfer feature being blocked in support of planned maintenance activities on Start-up Transformer (SUT) AENANX02. This prevented the RCPs from receiving power from the SUT after receipt of a trip signal from the main turbine generator. The preliminary root cause of the Unit 1 main turbine generator and reactor trip has been attributed to the susceptibility of the Unit 1 excitation and voltage regulation system (EX2100e) Exciter Auxiliary I/O Interface Board (EAUX) to electrical noise which led to an excitation trip of the Unit 1 main turbine generator. This condition was corrected on February 17, 2018, by replacing the Unit 1 EX2100e EAUX with an updated version that is less susceptible to electrical noise and thereby reduces the possibility of a spurious main turbine generator trip. The root cause is still considered preliminary as the event investigation is still in progress. Any significant changes identified will be reported in a supplement to this Licensee Event Report upon completion of the investigation.

Based on surveillance testing performed on 10/01/12 during the P2R19 refueling outage Instrumentation and Controls (I&C) personnel identified that two of the four instruments used to perform the Reactor Protection System (RPS) scram and End-of-Cycle Recirculation Pump Trip (EOC-RPT) functions for Turbine Control Valve (TCV) Fast Closure were outside of their Technical Specification allowable value of > 500 psig trip oil pressure. The 'A' pressure sensing instrument (PS-4121A) was found at a trip setting of 495 psig and the 'B' pressure sensing instrument (PS-4121B) was found at a trip setting of 493 psig. The cause of this event is due to instrument drift. This occurrence is reportable as a result of a common cause inoperability that resulted in two instruments drifting low outside of the Technical Specification allowable value. The 'A' and 'B' instruments were replaced and calibrated to within acceptable limits. There were no actual safety consequences associated with this event. If an operational transient would have occurred during power operations the 'C' and 'D' instrument channels were operable and would have provided the RPS scram and EOC-RPT trip functions.,"['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)']"
"On August 28, 2022, at 03:29 Eastern Daylight Time, with Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant Unit 1 (HNP) in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, the reactor was manually tripped in response to an automatic trip of the ""B"" main feedwater pump (MFP) caused by a trip of the ""B"" condensate pump (CP). The ""B"" CP tripped following an electrical failure of its motor. The trip of the ""B"" CP resulted in subsequent trips of the ""B"" condensate booster pump and the ""B"" MFP as designed. In accordance with plant procedures, the operations crew manually tripped the reactor upon the trip of a MFP with initial reactor power greater than 90 percent. The ""A"" MFP tripped shortly after the manual reactor trip due to a low suction pressure condition created from the condensate and feedwater transient. The trip of both MFPs resulted in an auto-start of the auxiliary feedwater pumps on low steam generator level as designed. Safety systems functioned as required. This event had no impact on the health and safety of the public. Causal factors that led to the ""B"" CP motor electrical failure will be determined from the ongoing cause evaluation. Once the evaluation is complete, a supplemental report will be issued containing the causal factors for this event. The ""B"" CP motor was replaced.

On January 26 and February 11  2015  five of eight Target Rock safety relief valve (SRV) pilot valve assemblies  removed during Refueling Outage 28  failed to lift within Technical Specification (TS) lift setpoint requirements. The pressure setpoint of the first failed pilot assembly is 1090 psig; the SRV pilot assembly lifted at 1124 psig. The pressure setpoint of the second failed pilot assembly is 1100 psig; the SRV pilot assembly lifted at 1192 psig. The pressure setpoint of the third failed pilot assembly is 1090 psig; the SRV pilot assembly lifted at 1267.7 psig. The pressure setpoint of the fourth failed pilot assembly is 1100 psig; the SRV pilot assembly lifted at 1139 psig. The pressure setpoint of the fifth failed pilot assembly is 1090 psig; the SRV pilot assembly lifted at 1138 psig. Two subsequent lifts were performed for all failed SRV pilot assemblies and the results were within the TS pressure setpoint tolerances. The probable cause is corrosion bonding with time being a possible exacerbating factor. Although the TS related to the set point lift pressures of the SRV pilot valve assemblies were exceeded  an analysis of this event indicates that the design basis pressures to ensure safety of the reactor vessel and its pressure related appurtenances were not challenged. Public safety was not at risk. Safety to plant personnel and plant equipment were not at risk.,"['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"

"On January 2, 2024, the 2A Emergency Diesel Generator (DG) was unloaded and secured prior to the completion of a periodic 5-hour run due to rising temperatures and air quality conditions in the 2A DG room. It was determined that the 2A1 Emergency Ventilation Fan Damper Controller was failed and did not allow the normal amount of outside air to circulate into the room. Additionally, the 2A2 Emergency Ventilation Fan was out of service in support of maintenance activities. As a result, 2A DG room temperatures increased to an off-normal level less than the alarm setpoint. The 2A DG was declared inoperable until the degraded damper controller was repaired. Further investigation revealed Catawba Nuclear Station had evidence the condition of the failed 2A1 Damper Controller, combined with the out of service 2A2 Ventilation Fan, had existed since December 5, 2023.

"On March 8, 2018, at 0130 Central Standard Time (CST), during a relay functional test of the C3 Emergency Equipment Cooling Water (EECW) Pump trip circuit, incorrect wiring was discovered on the C3 EECW Pump breaker. This condition would have prevented the breaker closing springs from recharging while the transfer switch was in the emergency position. On March 10, 2018, at 2042 CST, Maintenance personnel completed work to correct the wiring for the pump breaker.

"On November 23, 2015, a trip of the #11 Reactor Recirculation Pump occurred, followed by a Group 1 isolation which resulted in a reactor scram. A post scram troubleshooting investigation determined a large spike in differential pressure occurred in the 'C' main steam flow instrumentation line at the time of the Group 1 initiation event. The root cause of this event was determined to be legacy foreign material present in the 'C' main steam flow instrumentation line. This foreign material obstructed the instrumentation line and resulted in the momentary sensed high steam flow. The sensed high steam flow was not due to an actual high steam flow condition in the 'C' main steam line. Since the presence of foreign material in the instrument line is a legacy issue, the corrective action for the root cause was to remove the foreign material. The corrective action for the trip of the reactor recirculation pump will be to revise the fleet procedure to require verification of torque on accessible electrical connections for critical components which are bench tested and also to ensure that accessible soldered and crimped electrical terminations are inspected for signs of degradation during bench testing.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']

PNPS had already taken action in accordance with plant procedures to reduce power from 100 percent in an effort to keep from exceeding the Technical Specification (TS) Limit. PNPS entered a 24-hour shutdown Limiting Condition for Operation Action Statement (LCO-AS) for Salt Service Water (SSW) inlet temperature exceeding the TS limit in TS 3.5.B.4. The LCO-AS was subsequently exited at 1651 hours when the temperature of SSW trended to below the TS limit.

When the inlet temperature to these supplied loads exceeds the 75 degree F limit established in the TS, the SSW system is conservatively declared inoperable until the temperature trends below this value. This condition existed for 59 minutes reaching a maximum of 75.1 degrees F. The cause of the sea water inlet temperature exceeding the 75 degree F TS criterion was sustained increased sea water surface temperature in Cape Cod Bay due to summer weather conditions and recirculation of water from the plant's discharge due to wind and tidal conditions.

"On November 22, 2013, Hope Creek Generating Station (HCGS) received results of the 'as-found' setpoint testing for the safety relief valve (SRV) pilot stage assemblies. The results indicated that five SRV pilot stage assemblies' setpoints had exceeded the lift settings prescribed in the Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) for Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.2.1. The TS LCO requires the SRV lift settings to be within +/- 3% of the nominal setpoint value. All five of the valves failing to meet the limits were Target Rock Model 7567F two-stage SRVs. During the eighteenth refueling outage (H1R18), all 14 SRV pilot stage assemblies were removed and tested at an offsite test facility. A total of five of the 14 SRV pilot stage assemblies experienced setpoint drift outside of the TS 3.4.2.1 specified values. The cause of the setpoint drift for the five SRV pilot stage assemblies is attributed to corrosion bonding between the pilot disc and seating surfaces, which is consistent with industry experience. This conclusion is based on previous cause evaluations and the repetitive nature of this condition at HCGS and within the BWR industry.

With flow removed from the WI system and bypass valve XVB09210-WI closed, condensate flow to the Deaerator Storage Tank (DAST) was isolated. All operating main Feedwater pumps tripped on DAST Low-Low level setpoint. The water level in the Steam Generators decreased and resulted in a reactor trip. The cause of this event was failure of XVB09210-WI to stroke open due to a failed solenoid actuator and a procedure deficiency in manipulating the WI System.

"On December 13 2012 it was questioned whether both emergency diesel generators (DGs) would be considered inoperable if one diesel oil storage tank (DOST) room water tight door was impaired because the door between the DOST rooms was not water tight. The Plant Barrier Impairment Program procedure contained a pre-evaluated compensatory action for impairment of one of the DOST room water tight doors, which required declaring only the affected emergency diesel generator (DG) inoperable. A subsequent technical review determined that the compensatory note was incorrect and that both DOST rooms would be vulnerable to flooding with the water tight door for one DOST room impaired. A review of prior plant barrier impairments identified one instance in the previous three years where only one DG was declared inoperable while the corresponding water tight door was impaired. The cause of the event was determined to be inadequate technical rigor, which led to improper compensatory measures being included in the Plant Barrier Impairment Program procedure. The corrective action was to revise the procedure to consider both trains of the affected unit's DGs inoperable when either DOST water tight door was impaired.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']

The cause of the event was a combination of the isolating steam valve to the Reactor Feed Pump B (RFP B) being out of position, ninety percent closed, which isolates the main steam header from RFP B and a planned power reduction. The power reduction resulted in the turbine bypass valves (TBPV) opening as designed, then when the TBPVs reached 16 percent open, RFP B began to decrease in speed. This resulted in a decreasing level in the RPV. As level decreased, the Control Room Supervisor directed a manual scram be inserted prior to reaching the low level scram set point (+11.4 inches narrow range). After the scram, Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) was manually started to inject water into the RPV, and RFP A was restarted to restore and maintain reactor water level. The appropriate off-normal event procedures were entered to mitigate the transient with all systems responding as designed. All control rods inserted to shut down the reactor.

Subsequent troubleshooting found the RCIC governor controls dropping resistor in the power supply circuit to be partially open. This resulted in less than adequate power supply to the RCIC electronic governor which allowed the RCIC turbine to over- speed and trip on electronic over-speed. The RCIC governor controls dropping resistor was replaced and RCIC was returned to service on August 24  2013 at 0515.

The loss of 345KV power was due to faults from flashovers in the PNPS switchyard. All control rods fully inserted. The Emergency Diesel Generators had been previously started and were powering safety-related buses A5 and A6. The plant stabilized in Hot Shutdown. At the time of the event a significant winter storm (Juno) was buffeting Southern New England.

"On March 23, 2019, at approximately 1600 Central Daylight Time (CDT), while performing surveillance testing required prior to initial startup from the Unit 2 Refueling Outage, Local Leak Rate Testing (LLRT) identified the failure of a Primary Containment penetration for the Traversing In-core Probe (TIP) system. Further troubleshooting determined that the TIP Purge Header check valve was leaking by, rendering the test volume unable to be pressurized. The gross leakage Leak Rate value exceeded the Technical Specification allowable value for Type C valves of less than 60 percent of the allowable limit. On March 26, 2019, at approximately 1030 CDT, Engineering evaluation determined that the TIP System leakage test results related to LLRT of the TIP Purge Header Check Valve resulted in a reportable condition. At 1508 CDT, Event Notification was made to the NRC for a serious degradation of the reactor's principle safety barriers. The apparent cause of this event was foreign material in the body of the TIP Purge Header check valve which prevented the valve from seating. The immediate corrective action for this condition was to replace the failed valve. An additional corrective action will be implemented to add another check valve in series for penetrations affected by this condition to allow dual barrier containment isolation for Units 1, 2, and 3.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']"
"On December 17, 2014, at 1014 Central Standard Time (CST), the Fort Calhoun Station (FCS) reactor tripped due to a loss of load signal from the main turbine. The loss of load signal actuates the reactor protective system (RPS) which tripped the plant. The trip of the turbine was caused by a spurious actuation of a relay on the station unit auxiliary transformer that normally provides power to 4160 VAC bus 1A2. The root cause was that FCS had not ensured that an identified single point vulnerability for T1A-2 transformer was eliminated or had an adequate mitigating strategy. The control cabinet sealing was improved to reduce moisture from the interior of the cabinet. The relay that caused the trip was removed from the trip circuit. The station will modify the control circuits to eliminate the single point vulnerability in the transformer control cabinets.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On February 25, 2013, at approximately 1313 hours Central Standard Time, the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN), Unit 3 reactor automatically scrammed due to an actuation of the Reactor Protection System from a turbine trip. The turbine tripped on low condenser vacuum due to a reactor feedwater piping separation. The Main Steam Isolation Valves were manually closed. There was one Safety Relief Valve that was manually operated to maintain reactor pressure due to the unavailability of the Main Turbine Bypass Valves upon loss of condenser vacuum. All systems responded as expected to the turbine trip. No Emergency Core Cooling System or Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) system reactor water level initiation set points were reached. Reactor water level was controlled with the RCIC system and reactor pressure was controlled with the High Pressure Coolant Injection system. The root cause for this event is that the system design for BFN, Unit 3 Feedwater Long Cycle line does not account for flashing of water to steam due to isolation valve leakage. The corrective action to prevent recurrence is to redesign Feed Water Long Cycle lines downstream of each Feed Water Long Cycle isolation valve and upstream of the Miscellaneous Drain Header with a valve and piping configuration appropriately designed for the specified application.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On September 26  2013  at 1717 hours with Unit 1 in Mode 6  zero percent power  core alterations began with two inoperable emergency diesel generators. One emergency diesel generator (1J EDG)  in a two train system  was out of service for maintenance with the second emergency diesel generator (1H EDG) inoperable  but unknown at the time. A subsequent failure of the 1H EDG during a 24 hour run  parallel to the grid  determined prior inoperability. Technical Specifications 3.8.2 requires one operable qualified circuit between the offsite transmission network and the onsite Class 1E AC electrical power distribution subsystem(s) required by TS 3.8.10 and one OPERABLE EDG. A cause evaluation is currently being finalized to determine the apparent cause of the 1H EDG inoperability. One qualified circuit between the offsite transmission network and the onsite Class 1E AC electrical power distribution subsystem(s)  required by TS 3.8.10  was OPERABLE and the station blackout EDG was also available. Additionally  had a loss of offsite power occurred  the 1H EDG would have been able to supply power in the isochronous mode to the emergency bus.

"From April 19 through April 29, 2018, with Hope Creek Generating Station (HCGS) in a planned refueling outage and the reactor cavity flooded in OPCON 5, HCGS performed operations with a potential to drain the reactor vessel (OPDRV) without an operable secondary containment. These operations are prohibited by Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.5.1; however, NRC guidance provided in Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 11-003, Revision 3, allowed the implementation of interim actions as an alternative to full compliance. These actions were compiled in a plant procedure for controlling OPDRV activities performed at HCGS during Refueling Outages. Three OPDRV activities were planned activities that were completed under the guidance of plant procedures and confirmed to have low safety significance based on the interim actions taken. Since these actions were deliberate, no cause determination was necessary. One OPDRV activity was not planned and occurred as a result of equipment failure. Consistent with the guidance provided in EGM 11-003, Revision 3, HCGS submitted a license amendment request on September 22, 2017, to adopt a Technical Specification Task Force (TSTF) traveler associated with generic resolution of this issue.

The PSV lifted below the Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.10 allowable lift setting value. Setpoint drift is the cause of the PSV failure. It is likely that the PSV was outside of the TS limits longer than the allowable completion times for the associated Required Action Statements during the previous operating cycle in all applicable modes of operation.

The plant entered Mode 4 on April 28 2015 at 0144 Central Daylight Time (CDT). Upon discovery the air supply valves for the two containment shutdown purge valves were locked closed, removing the motive force. The cause of the event was the decision to only track components listed in the manual Locked Component Log during plant start-up, which allowed a mode change with components out of position.

On June 16  2017  with the plant in Mode 1 and 100% reactor power  the 'A' Ultimate Heat Sink (UHS) Cooling Tower Fan was operating in fast-speed to cool the UHS retention pond. The fan spuriously tripped after 44 minutes of operation. The most probable cause of the spurious trip was a defective fast-speed thermal overload relay that had been installed as a replacement during recent preventative maintenance activities. In Mode 1  Technical Specifications require each of two redundant UHS cooling tower trains to be capable of dissipating the heat contained in the Essential Service Water (ESW) system. An inoperable UHS cooling tower fan renders its UHS cooling tower train inoperable. Review determined that the fan was inoperable from the start of the preventative maintenance task  and existed for a duration of 96 hours and 23 minutes while the plant was in Mode 1.

"On September 28, 2015, at 20:46, with the Hope Creek reactor operating at 100% power, a human error during surveillance testing resulted in the actuation of the Redundant Reactivity Control System (RRCS) and subsequently, an automatic reactor scram on a valid low water level signal. At the time of the transient, a surveillance test of division 1 of the RRCS system was in progress. The test simulates a high reactor pressure signal. Plant data show the signal was entered in both channels of division 1 of the RRCS system. The resulting system actuation caused a trip of both Reactor Recirculation Pumps and the actuation of the Alternate Rod Insertion (ARI) function of the RRCS system. As a result of these two actuations, reactor power lowered causing reactor water level to lower to the Reactor Protection System (RPS) trip set point of +12.5 inches. The RPS initiated an automatic reactor scram. Reactor operators recovered water level to within the desired band using the feedwater system. Reactor pressure was maintained using turbine bypass valves discharging to the main condenser. A cause evaluation is being conducted to determine the causes associated with the event.

"On July 18, 2024, at 1524, Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant Unit 2 incurred an uncomplicated automatic reactor trip from 100 percent power due to a Main Turbine Loss of Load trip initiated by the Reactor Protection System (RPS). The Loss of Load trip was the result of an internal Main Generator Exciter failure that led to a loss of field on the Main Generator that in turn led to a load reject trip from the Main Turbine. The direct cause of the Exciter failure was a failed stationary field pole electrical connection. An engineering analysis performed to determine the failure mechanism for the stationary failed field pole electrical connection identified cyclic fatigue as the cause for the failure. Impacted Exciter components were replaced and an extent of condition inspection on the other field pole electrical connections was performed prior to returning the Exciter to service. The root cause investigation for this event identified that Engineering personnel and their leadership failed to adequately exhibit technical conscience principles and the technical human performance behaviors Challenge and Questioning Attitude resulting in the cyclic fatigue of a single point vulnerability component that led to a plant trip.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']

A past operability review was conducted and on 12/03/20 the results concluded that the EDG would not have been able to perform its safety function with the amount of water found in the day tank. The source of water in the day tank was from accumulated water in the FOST being pumped to the day tank during a fuel transfer system surveillance on 4/29/20. Water from an underground pipe leak had entered a nearby pull box, traversed conduit connecting to the FOST manway, collected in the manway and then seeped into the FOST through threaded connections on top of the tank.

"During a Clinton Power Station (CPS) review of an event at the Browns Ferry Station (ENS 47374), CPS determined that the original plant wiring design for the station battery ammeter circuits contains a shunt in the current flow from each direct current (DC) battery. Bolted onto the shunt bar are two Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) IEEE-383 qualified leads to an ammeter in the main control room (MCR). The small difference in voltage between the two taps on the shunt is enough to deflect the current meter in the MCR when current flows from the battery through the shunt. The ammeter wiring attached to the shunt does not have fuses, and if one of the ammeter wires shorts to ground at the same time another DC wire from the opposite polarity on the same battery also shorts to ground, a ground loop through the unfused ammeter cable could occur. With enough current going through the cable, the potential exists that the overloaded ammeter wiring could damage safe shutdown wiring in direct physical contact with the cable resulting in a loss of the associated safe shutdown function/capability. The cause of this deficiency is the original design criteria not specifying protection for shunt fed ammeter circuits. A modification is planned to correct the deficiency.

This indication appeared to be an erroneous indication as reactor power and pressure remained stable. The system contains two channels of pressure regulation, an ""A"" and ""B"" channel. A failure in either channel could cause the light to illuminate. A troubleshooting team was developed to determine the potential failure modes. On October 13, 2022, during problem solving for the Maximum Combined Flow Limiter In Control light, the problem solving team determined the ""A"" channel was operating normally and that the ""B"" channel would prevent the bypass valves from responding to a pressure perturbation with the steam bypass and regulating system operating on the ""B"" channel. The control room shifted off the ""B"" channel to the ""A"" channel and declared the ""B"" channel inoperable.

"On May 22, 2012, at 0249 Central Daylight Time, the BFN Unit 3 reactor was automatically scrammed due to de-energization of the Reactor Protection System from actuation of the 3A Unit Station Service Transformer (USST) differential relay 387SA, which resulted in a loss of 500 kilovolt (kV) power to BFN Unit 3. All safety systems responded as expected to the loss of 500kV power. No Emergency Core Cooling System or Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) System reactor water level initiation set points were reached. The RCIC System was manually started to control reactor water level. Primary Containment Isolation System initiation signals for groups 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 were received as expected due to loss of power. The immediate cause of this event was the 3A USST differential relay was installed with incorrect design calculation settings which resulted in the BFN Unit 3 scram. The root cause of this condition was inadequate procedural guidance within NEDP-5 Design Document Reviews for the types of review required by engineering. The corrective action to prevent recurrence is to revise NEDP-5 Design Document Reviews to establish the definition and requirements for each type of review.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
During an operator tour of the train A Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) room on March 1  2014 at approximately 12:39  it was discovered that the filter housing cover on the EDG A Starting Air Filter had unfastened from its base and was lying on the floor. The last successful start of the EDG A that demonstrated its capability to meet its safety function was on February 27  2014 at 11:33 and it is postulated that the cover became unfastened during that run. Therefore  EDG was potentially inoperable for 2 days as a result of this condition. Since the condition was unknown at the time  the Technical Specifications required test of EDG B was not performed within 8 hours and the requirement to demonstrate the operability of the remaining A.C. circuits at least once per 8 hours or to be in Hot Shutdown within the next 6 hours was not performed. The cause was insufficient tightening of the filter housing cover during maintenance on April 8  2013. The insufficient tightening had not been preventing the EDG A's ability to start within the required times prior to its becoming unfastened. EDG A was returned to OPERABLE condition by refastening the filter housing cover to its base. The other filter housings on EDG A and EDG B were verified to be properly fastened. An evaluation is being conducted to determine if a torque requirement is necessary for the filter housing covers.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"At 1801 hours EST on 11/5/2013 with the Unit in Mode 1 at 19% power Robinson Nuclear Plant (RNP) experienced an automatic reactor trip while operators were transferring loads from the Startup Transformer (SUT) [EA] to the Unit Auxiliary Transformer (UAT) [EA] as part of activities associated with coming on line and increasing power following Refueling Outage 28. During the coordinated breaker operation, the reactor tripped when an anomaly occurred that resulted in the actuation of two undervoltage relays associated with the loss of 2 of 3 4KV buses. The 'A' Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG)[EB] auto-started and supplied the E-1 emergency bus [EB] as a result of the undervoltage transient. The investigation into the cause of this event determined that advanced aging/fatigue of the phenolic operating rods of the UAT breaker (52/7) caused the failure of the 'B' phase operating rod, which prevented closure of the 'B' phase of the breaker. The corrective action to address rod failure involved replacement of operating rods in all four incoming breakers. The cause of the failure of the 'A' Service Water Pump to sequence onto the E-1 bus during the blackout sequence was attributed to a loose wire termination in the Emergency Control Station. This event did not impact the health and safety of the public.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"During scheduled testing at the offsite testing facility the as-found lift settings for the pressurizer safety valves (PSVs) previously installed in Unit 1 at the 1RV200 and 1RV201 locations were measured outside the Technical Specification allowable values (both valves lifted low). The valves had been installed during the 2012 Unit 1 refueling outage and were removed during the 2014 Unit 1 refueling outage for scheduled testing and maintenance. Spare valves were installed during the 2014 refueling outage. The failed valves were disassembled and inspected at the offsite facility. The apparent cause of the PSV failures is that the internal lift spring assemblies of a specific manufacturer lot failed to hold PSV set pressure. This apparent cause will be verified as the removed internal lift spring assemblies for each valve is further reviewed, examined, and tested to support this apparent cause. No other installed PSVs contain internal lift spring assemblies from this specific manufacturer's lot.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)']"
"On July 7, 2015, at approximately 1435 EDT, during Post-Maintenance Testing (PMT) of the Reactor Building Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (RBHVAC) System with the Standby Gas Treatment System (SGTS) operating, Secondary Containment (SC) pressure exceeded Technical Specification (TS) limits for approximately 41 seconds. At 1436 EDT, SC pressure was restored to within the TS limit of less than or equal to -0.125 inches water column. The cause of the event was reverse rotation of the RBHVAC center exhaust fan due to reversed electrical leads. Personnel responsible for oversight and execution of the PMT did not appropriately consider the possibility and adverse effects of prolonged reverse rotation. As a result, a normal post-installation test activity (i.e., a motor ""bump-check"" for rotation) was deviated from and produced unintended consequences. Corrective actions to improve decision-making and clarify work instructions are planned. There were no radiological releases associated with this event.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']
"On February 18  2017  at 3:37 p.m. CST  while a refueling outage was in progress  the operators were shifting subsystems of the main control building ventilation system. The Division 2 ""B"" chiller had been in service  and it was intended to start the Division 1 ""C"" chiller to facilitate the outage work schedule. After the swap  operators noted that the air flow was abnormally low  and within approximately four minutes  the ""C"" chiller tripped. The operators were unsuccessful in attempts to restore the Division 2 subsystem to service  and the abnormal operating procedures for the loss of control building ventilation were then implemented. The electrical distribution subsystems in the control building were declared inoperable due to the loss of the ventilation system. As described in the causal analysis  a circuit breaker manufacturing defect that violated the single failure requirements of Appendix A  General Design Criteria  was discovered. During the restoration of the ventilation system  main control room temperature increased from approximately 73F to 81F as recorded in the operator's logs. No high temperature alarms from the electrical equipment rooms actuated.

"On March 8, 2022, a fuel oil tanker truck delivered a new fuel oil shipment of diesel fuel oil to Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant. As required per station procedure, samples were taken from the fuel oil tanker, with those necessary parameters verified within specification, prior to adding fuel oil to the fuel oil storage tanks. Other parameters, including fuel oil lubricity, may be analyzed after fuel oil is added to the storage tanks. The analysis for those parameters must be received within 31 days following the initial fuel oil sample. Sample results for the new fuel oil delivered on March 8, 2022, which were received on March 25, 2022, documented a lubricity value of 614 micrometers, which is above the acceptance criteria of less than 520 micrometers. However, an issue report was not generated, and the Operations Department was not notified; therefore, the required technical specification actions were not taken within the required action completion time. This represents a condition prohibited by the plant's technical specifications. The fuel oil in the fuel oil storage tanks was subsequently sampled and analyzed, with lubricity determined to be within the acceptable limit.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"As part of an apparent cause evaluation Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) identified an incorrect insulation configuration installed in 2010 on the thermal extension piping that houses the wires for the wide range (WR) reactor coolant system (RCS) resistance temperature detectors (RTDs). The insulation configuration as installed trapped heat inside the thermal extension piping and overheated the wires. The cause of the incorrect configuration of the insulation was insufficient guidance in the associated work package instructions. An engineering analysis completed on October 5, 2015, determined that the eight WR RCS RTDs had either failed or were operating outside the environmental qualification temperature range. As a result, on October 5, 2015, PG&E determined that the required number of WR RTDs would not have been operable and therefore a violation of Technical Specification 3.3.3, ""Post Accident Monitoring (PAM) Instrumentation,"" had occurred. As part of the corrective actions, PG&E replaced all eight WR RTDs, restored the insulation per the design requirements, revised the drawings for Unit 1 WR RTDs to provide adequate level of detail, and revised the work order to include the correct drawing and level of details for proper installation of all WR RTDs.

"During the February 2017 Unit 2 refueling outage two main steam safety relief valves (SRV) did not pass Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement 3.4.4.1 and Inservice Testing (IST) Program lift pressure requirements. Both SRVs (2B21-F013C and 2B21-F013L) lifted below their expected lift pressures. On February 16, 2017, SRV 2B21-F013C was required to lift within plus or minus three percent of 1175 psi (i.e. 1175 psi plus or minus 35.2 psi), but actually lifted at 1131 psi. On February 17, 2017, SRV 2B21-F013L was required to lift within plus or minus three percent of 1195 psi (i.e. 1195 psi plus or minus 35.8 psi), but actually lifted at 1130 psi. Both SRVs lifted prior to their expected lift pressures, which is conservative in regards to maintaining reactor pressure vessel over-pressure limits. Both SRVs were replaced during the outage.

The plant was stabilized at 3 percent reactor power with the Auxiliary Feedwater System feeding all Steam Generators with all levels within their normal bands. The cause of the Turbine trip was high water level in Steam Generator 2-02 related to the mechanical malfunction of a Steam Generator 2-02 flow control bypass valve. The valve malfunctioned due to a loose locknut on the valve hand wheel. Corrective actions included repair of the Steam Generator 2-02 flow control bypass valve.

At 06:45 on November 8  2023  the 22 Steam Generator Feedwater Pump (SGFP) tripped on high casing water level. The pump was in service supporting heat removal following the Unit 2 automatic reactor trip that occurred the previous day. The 21 SGFP was in standby at the time and had a high casing water level as well. Therefore  Operations entered the applicable procedure and manually started the 23 auxiliary feedwater pump to reinitiate flow to the steam generators. Plant conditions during the event resulted in an excessive accumulation of condensate in the SGFP turbine casings. Station procedures did not account for the specific set of conditions that resulted in the SGFP turbine casing high water levels. This challenged operation of both SGFPs. The high turbine casing water level was corrected via a station work order. Planned corrective actions include review of station procedures for plant configurations similar to those realized during the subject event  and a performance analysis to determine if additional training is needed.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On February 22, 2012, at 2319 hours Eastern Standard Time (EST), a manual Reactor Protection System (RPS) actuation was inserted on Unit 1 in anticipation of a loss of condenser vacuum. Shortly before the manual RPS actuation, Circulating Water Intake Pump (CWIP) 1B tripped due to high delta-pressure across the intake traveling screen. This caused the trip of the remaining Unit 1 CWIPs. Previously, at 1859 hours, balance of plant (BOP) bus Common C unexpectedly de-energized. This resulted in a loss of power to the CWIP traveling screen motors which, in turn, lead to the high delta-pressure across the traveling screens. As a result of the scram, reactor water level reached the Reactor Vessel Water Level - Low Level 1 actuation set point and Primary Containment Isolation System (PCIS) Groups 2 and 6 isolations occurred. Additionally, the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) (i.e., PCIS Group 1) were manually closed prior to reaching the Condenser Vacuum - Low actuation set point. The root cause of this event is inadequate preventive maintenance (PM) for the 4160/480 V transformer associated with the Common C BOP bus.

On January 23  2016  James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) was ascending in power when screenwell water level started to lower. At 89 percent power  at 22:23  Operators began taking compensatory measures to reduce power and mitigate water level lowering. At 22:40  a manual scram was initiated. The scram was complicated by a residual transfer that resulted in non-vital equipment trips. This event resulted in the manual actuation of the Reactor Protection System  High Pressure Coolant Injection  Reactor Core Isolation Cooling  Main Steam Isolation Valves and automatic actuation of Emergency Diesel Generators  Emergency Service Water  and containment isolations in multiple systems. The lowering screenwell water level was caused by frazil ice blockage at the intake structure. The frazil ice stopped affecting screenwell water level after the manual scram. Corrective actions include strengthening mitigating actions in response to frazil ice. The residual transfer was caused by lubrication hardening in the lower control valve assembly of the 71PCB-10042 breaker. Corrective actions included replacing or reworking the lower control valve assembly.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']

The assumptions ensure compliance with Technical Specification (TS) Section 4.3.1.1.b to maintain a spent fuel pool K-effective (Keff) of less than or equal to (</=) 0.95. An extent of condition review indicates additional at-risk rack locations that may further challenge compliance with TS 4.3.1.1.b.

Interim actions include declaring the spent fuel pool rack cells adjacent to the panel RR35 South inoperable  installing blade guides into cells adjacent to panel RR35S  and prohibiting fuel movement in Boraflex racks. An additional corrective action was taken to perform a criticality evaluation of the spent fuel pool (SPF). This LER supplement is issued to identify that an additional criticality evaluation has been performed to conservatively identify fuel storage configurations within the Boraflex fuel storage racks that will ensure the Boraflex racks Keff will be able to be maintained </= 0.95.

Subsequent cleanup of the boric acid accumulation revealed an active leak of 3 drops per minute. A visual inspection identified that the source of the leak was a circumferential crack on the socket weld. DCPP determined that system vibration induced a low-stress, high-cycle fatigue which caused the socket weld to fail. DCPP replaced the socket weld. The new weld has improved fatigue resistance over the original, equal-leg socket weld.

"On September 13, 2017, with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station operating at approximately 100 percent power, Auxiliary Feed Water (AFW) Pump Turbine 1 experienced high inboard bearing temperature during performance of quarterly Surveillance Testing. The turbine was tripped, and disassembly revealed damage to the journal bearing. The bearing was replaced, and following successful post maintenance testing, AFW Train 1 was declared Operable on September 16. The cause of the bearing damage was an improperly marked oil sight glass, which allowed operation with improper bearing lubrication. The improper markings were due to the maintenance work instruction for replacing the sight glass not including dimensions or guidance for setting required operational bands. On September 26, 2017, it was identified that low inboard bearing oil level had likely existed since completion of the previous quarterly surveillance test on June 21, when an oil sample was taken following testing but the bearing was not refilled due to the improperly marked sight glass.

Without adequate overcurrent protection for these circuits, a fire-induced short could lead to excessive current through the circuits. This could lead to secondary damage in another fire area where the circuits are routed, challenging the ability to achieve and maintain safe shutdown. Extent of condition review revealed several additional circuits, including circuits within Unit 3.

The cause of the Turbine-Generator load reject trip has two factors. First the Unit Supervisor misinterpreted a step in the governing procedure. Second the Unit Supervisor believed the circuit was de-energized and safe to perform the continuity check because the electricians were unable to identify voltage at the open contacts when voltage was present. The full trip was initiated when the electricians jumpered across the remaining open contacts with an ohm meter in the load reject circuit. The corrective actions include re-enforcement of the Technical Human Performance (THU) behaviors that were lacking during the pre-job brief and the initial review of the procedure, and enhanced guidance within the procedure for contact status checks.

On May 19  2017  at 0206 hours  an unexpected Reactor Protection System (RPS) actuation occurred during pre-startup testing. The reactor was shutdown at the time  with all control rods inserted. The portion of the test that was in progress is designed to actuate the RPS from a loss of load input signal. To facilitate this part of the test with the reactor in a shutdown mode  one of two conditional steps in the procedure is to be taken. The generator motor operated disconnect 389 (MOD-389) is required to be in the open position  or protective trip circuity for the generator is required to be bypassed. Due to a conditional step of the test procedure being misinterpreted by a Nuclear Control Operator (NCO)  MOD-389 was left in the closed position and the generator protective trip circuity was not bypassed. This resulted in the RPS actuation occurring prior to the preplanned sequence. The RPS responded as designed. All components operated as expected for the plant conditions. The cause of the unexpected RPS actuation was human performance errors during procedure performance  e.g.  lack of self-validation/verification  misinterpretation of information  and lack of peer check verification. Corrective actions from the event include the removal of the NCO's licensed operator qualifications until remediated and initiation of a standing order requiring peer check verification for all procedure conditional steps until the applicable administrative procedure is revised.

Reactor coolant pumps normally powered through the non-safety buses were deenergized, and decay heat removal was via natural circulation and Auxiliary Feedwater. The lockout relay actuation was caused by a latent error introduced during a 2013 design modification where the maintenance configuration control procedure did not prevent a wire from being inadvertently removed from the circuit.

"On October 20  2023 at 0240 hours  with Millstone Power Station Unit 3 at 0 percent reactor power in Mode 4  the ""B"" pressurizer power operated relief valve (PORV)  3RCS*PCV456  failed to stroke open upon demand during performance of surveillance testing. The failed PORV was replaced with a rebuilt PORV and new pilot solenoid operated valve and passed all required post maintenance tests. The direct cause of the 'B' PORV failure to stroke was a failed pilot solenoid operated valve (SOV). Although it could not be determined when 3RCS*PCV456 became inoperable  it was likely not capable of stroking open in Mode 1-3 for a period exceeding the 72-hour allowed outage time of Technical Specification.

"On January 8, 2013, at 0500 hours Central Standard Time (CST), Required Action B.4.1 of Technical Specification (TS) 3.8.1 was entered when the 'B' diesel generator (DG) was declared inoperable for performing voluntary preplanned maintenance activities. During the planned replacement of the o-ring between the cylinder head and valve housing on the number 7 cylinder, maintenance personnel contacted one of the eight cylinder head studs and identified that the stud was loose. The broken stud was removed by hand. On January 10, 2013, enforcement discretion was sought to permit noncompliance with TS 3.8.1, i.e., to permit additional time to complete repairs and restoration of the 'B' DG before a plant shutdown was required. An additional 96 hours was requested to restore the 'B' DG to operable status such that the Completion Time of Required Action B.4.1 would expire at 0500 hours CST on January 15, 2013. The NRC granted approval of the requested enforcement discretion on January 10, 2013.

"On March 27, 2012, Operations declared the Extended Range (E/R) Flux Lower Range Nuclear Instrument (NI-45A) inoperable based on failure to meet channel check acceptance criteria per the ""Remote Shutdown Monitoring AND Accident Monitoring Instrumentation Channel Checks"" Procedure. Subsequent troubleshooting discovered an issue with the channel's isolation circuit card AT1. The AT1 card was found with a degraded condition which affected the output range of NI-45A. With this degraded condition, Extended Range (E/R) Flux Lower Range Nuclear Instrument (NI-45A) would not have been able to perform its design function. Subsequent review determined that NI-45A had been inoperable since February 29, 2012. After replacement of the AT1 card, the surveillance procedure was completed satisfactory on March 30, 2012, and the instrument was restored to operable. Since NI-45 had been inoperable for longer than the applicable Technical Specification 7 day Allowed Outage Time, this event is reportable as an Operation or Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications. This is the initial LER for this event. A planned Supplemental LER will be submitted as indicated above.

On December 31 2013 while Unit 2 was in Mode 3 (Hot Standby) the Hot Gap clearance checks and adjustments were being performed following the Steam Generator (SG) Replacement Project. During the performance of the Hot Gap checks it was discovered that multiple Upper Lateral Support (ULS) shims were removed from both 21 and 22 SG. This resulted in both Reactor Coolant System (RCS) loops being declared inoperable and entering Technical Specification (Tech Specs) 3.4.5 Condition D for the RCS loops while in Mode 3. This placed both RCS loops in an unanalyzed condition for seismic and pipe rupture analysis and required an 8 hours report to the NRC via Event Notification (49685). Additionally based on further analysis it was determined that with both RCS loops inoperable the condition required the notification to be updated to include a loss of safety function. Actions were taken to reinstall all of the ULS shims which restored the proper configuration to meet operability requirements for seismic and pipe rupture acceptance criteria. The installation was completed on December 31 2013 at 1728 CST at which time Tech Specs 3.4.5 Condition D was exited. The Root Cause to this event was the Steam Generator Replacement Project (SGRP) failure to document on the design drawings their assumption that the Unit 2 ULS shim packs would be measured and adjusted one shim pack at a time while making adjustments in Mode 3.,"['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ix)(A)']"
On 11/26/2014 the Robinson Nuclear Regulatory Commission Resident notified plant staff that the practice of crediting the plant computer (Emergency Response Facility Information System or ERFIS) in lieu of Rod Position Indication (RPI) and not entering the required actions of Technical Specification (TS) 3.1.7 had been reviewed and concluded that this practice was not allowed per the TS. One occurrence was found where the required actions for TS 3.1.7 were not entered due to crediting ERFIS. On 6/26/2014 Operators identified a discrepancy between RPI indicator and ERFIS indication for a single control rod. Licensed Operators determined that entry into LCO 3.1.7 was not required and ERFIS was documented as acceptable for RPI system operability. All ERFIS RPI indications remained normal and within limits. Troubleshooting of the RPI on 06/30/2015 revealed that the signal conditioner to the RPI display had failed and the ERFIS display for the control rod in question was accurate showing that the control rod was within limits; therefore there were no safety impacts from this event. Actions were to suspend this practice and issue Standing Instruction 14-023. Operations Surveillance Test procedures were revised to remove language that supported operator actions to credit ERFIS data. The condition was entered into the site's corrective action program.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On June 8, 2017 at 1527 hours, the reactor automatically scrammed due to a loss of Main Turbine- Electro-Hydraulic Control (EHC) logic power causing a high neutron flux, Reactor Protection System (RPS) trip. The safety systems operated as expected. Secondary Containment differential pressure lowered to 0"" WG due to a trip of the normal operation of the Reactor Building Ventilation system. The differential pressure was restored by the initiation of Standby Gas Treatment System. The scram was caused directly by a DC+ (direct current positive) test lead (Maxi Grabber) that inadvertently contacted with the grounding screw, causing a short and momentary loss of EHC logic power. Immediate action was taken to validate that there was no damage to the +30 VDC (volts DC) EHC logic. The root cause for this event is an insufficient focus on the High Risk Activity of adjusting the EHC power supply, and inadequate risk mitigating actions for that activity. There were no actual or potential consequences to the health and safety of the public as a result of this event.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']"
"Between October 2009 and March 2012 Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant (CPNPP) Units 1 and 2 experienced three failures of safety related breaker control devices that caused Technical Specification equipment to become inoperable. Two of the failures were on Unit 1 and one of the failures was on Unit 2. On June 14, 2012, a failure analysis concluded that these failures were caused by a material weakness of the control devices' contact carrier frames due to a manufacturing defect. Less than adequate control of the manufacturing process increased the susceptibility to shock loading of the cured phenolic material used to make the contact carrier frames. On June 20, 2012, CPNPP determined that this condition was reportable. Corrective actions include replacement of the potentially affected safety related breaker control devices, development of receipt inspection testing criteria to be used for breaker control devices, issuing an Operating Experience Report on this event, and notification of the breaker vendor (ABB Inc.).

On February 26 and 27 2020 with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station operating at approximately 74 percent power setpoint testing determined three of the Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSVs) had a setpoint more than three percent below the desired setpoint. These setpoints exceeded the Inservice Test Program allowable value rendering the valves inoperable in accordance with the Technical Specifications. The setpoint of each MSSV was adjusted as necessary to within one percent of the desired setpoint upon discovery. Based on the low as-found lift setting pressures the ability of the MSSVs to provide overpressure protection for the secondary system was not adversely impacted. The cause of this event is under evaluation. This event is being reported as a condition prohibited by the Technical Specifications.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On November 18, 2015 at approximately 23:33 hours with Unit 3 in Mode 5 during a refueling outage, the 3B Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) automatically started and loaded on the 3B bus. The cause of the EDG start was a loss of offsite power to the 3A and 3B 4160V busses when the supply breakers to the Unit 3 Startup Transformer automatically opened due to an unexpected protective relay actuation in the Unit 3 switchyard. When the 3A and 3B busses were deenergized, the 3B EDG re-energized the 3B bus, but the 3A sequencer was out of service for preplanned work so the 3A bus was not immediately reenergized. The unit remained in Mode 5 with core decay heat removal provided by the 3B Residual Heat Removal loop. The cause of the event was the unexpected actuation of the protective relay during switchyard work.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On July 3  '2013  operators initiated a manual reactor trip as a result of lowering steam generator (SG) levels due to the loss of feedwater (FW) from the trip of both main FW pumps. All control rods fully inserted and all required safety systems functioned properly. The plant was stabilized in hot standby with decay heat being removed by the main condenser. The Auxiliary Feedwater System automatically started as expected. Investigations determined the decreasing SG levels were due to a loss of main FW flow as a result of the closure of the FW regulating valves. The FW regulating valves closed due to a loss of instrument air (IA) pressure. The IA pressure was lost when a two inch copper IA tubing in the 22 Main Transformer moat separated at a soldered coupling. Prior to the event piping lines including the IA line buried in the main transformer moat were excavated and temporary supports installed. The apparent cause was poor legacy workmanship assembling the IA tubing coupling during original plant construction. The IA tubing was not fully inserted into the coupling resulting in reduced joint strength. Corrective actions included reassembly and soldering of the IA joint with full insertion  acoustic emission and snoop testing on repaired coupling. Axial and thrust restraints were installed on the IA line in the moat. A caution was placed in the Buried Piping Program database associated with buried copper tubing identifying the potential for the separation of soldered joints when the line is excavated and the need for restraints or other contingencies to minimize the probability of a line separation. The event had no effect on public health and safety.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On December 16, 2013, an extent of condition review related to an Appendix R Operator Manual Action deficiency identified that fire damage to a non-isolated 250 VDC control cable could cause Residual Heat Removal (RHR) Pump 2C to spuriously start when its associated 4kV Shutdown Board B is credited by Appendix R analysis. The control cable is routed from the 4kV Shutdown Board to the RHR Loop I drain valve/limit switch interlock. An undesired spurious start of RHR Pump 2C could overload the credited Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) or take away the necessary load capacity to allow operation of other Appendix R fire safe shutdown credited loads. A similar condition exists for RHR Pumps 1A, 1B, 1D, 2A, 2B, 3A, and 3C. Safe Shutdown Instructions (SSIs) follow a single safe shutdown path that consists of one train of credited equipment including one EDG, one 4kV Shutdown Board, and one RHR pump.

On March 12  2013  during scheduled testing at an offsite testing facility  the as-found lift setting for pressurizer safety valve  serial number BN04375  was measured higher than the Technical Specification allowable value. The valve had been installed in Unit 2 at the 2RV200 location (Unit 2 pressurizer safety valve) and was removed during the 2013 Unit 2 refueling outage for scheduled testing and maintenance. No material conditions were found that contributed to the high setpoint discovered during the test. The apparent cause is insufficient margin to address time-related drift. Corrective actions are to increase the Technical Specification setpoint tolerance and revise the procurement engineering standard as-left margin.

Troubleshooting commenced  but the condition could not be duplicated  and the block valve (a motor operated valve) (MOV) was tested and successfully cycled several times with no issues. The valve was declared operable and returned to service at 14:18 hours. On January 29  2019  additional testing and inspection of the block valve Motor Control Center (MCC) breaker was performed  and a nylon brush bristle was found within the contactor  inhibiting one phase of power to the MOV motor. Operability of the valve was required on December 4  2018  when Unit 2 was in Intermediate Shutdown and heating up for return to power operation. Due to foreign material located in the contactor causing inconsistent operation  the block valve was conservatively determined to be inoperable since maintenance was performed on the MCC breaker during the Unit 2 2018 refueling outage.

On October 15  October 20  and October 23  2013  with Hope Creek Generating Station (HCGS) in a planned refueling outage and the reactor cavity flooded up in OPCON 5  HCGS performed operations with a potential to drain the reactor vessel (OPDRV) without an operable secondary containment. These operations are prohibited by Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.4.1; however recent NRC guidance provided in Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 11-003  Revision 1  allowed the implementation of interim actions as an alternative to full compliance. These actions were compiled in a plant procedure for the OPDRV activities performed at HCGS during Refueling Outage (H1R18) in October 2013. These OPDRV activities were planned activities that were completed under the guidance of plant procedures and confirmed to have low safety significance based on the interim actions taken.

On March 24  2019 at 0026  with Unit 2 in Mode 1 and ascending in power  Control Room Operators noticed the Main Condenser was losing vacuum and initiated a power reduction. Due to vacuum continuing to degrade  Operators lowered reactor power down to 25 percent and initiated a manual reactor SCRAM at 0159. Following the trip of the Main Turbine  the non-safety Station Service 4160V buses failed to fast bus transfer from normal to the alternate power supply resulting in the loss of all non-safety loads. Operators entered an abnormal operating procedure for the Loss of 4160V buses to manually re- energize the Station Service buses. The de-energized Station Service buses resulted in a loss of the Condensate Feedwater system. Reactor water level was then maintained by the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling system while pressure was controlled by High Pressure Coolant Injection. A primary containment isolation signal was received on low reactor water level. Corrective actions were taken to properly align the Steam Jet Air Ejector system  which was the cause of the loss of condenser vacuum  and to replace the failed relay  which caused the failure of the Station Service buses to transfer.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On 1/26/12 a first time low voltage pickup test was performed for 71MCC-163-OE5 (East Crescent Unit Cooler 66UC-22H Fan Motor). The contactor picked up at 102 VAC versus the 90 VAC Acceptance Criteria. A calculation was performed to determine the Acceptance Criteria for this application. The Acceptance Criterion was established as 97 VAC. The failure to meet the Acceptance Criteria is a reportable condition because the Unit Cooler would not have been able to perform its support function to provide cooling to ECCS subsystems in the East Crescent Area. TRM Specification 3.7.C requires that at least 4 unit coolers in each crescent are functional in Modes 1-3. Also, Crescent Area Unit Cooler performance testing establishes a maximum UHS Temperature at which 4 unit coolers will maintain the Operability of the ECCS. During the period evaluated in this LER there were 1) multiple occasions when other unit coolers in the East Crescent Area were out of service concurrent with 66UC-22H being non-functional; and 2) there were no occasions where the temperature allowed by the performance testing was exceeded for a period of time greater than allowed by the TRM. Exceeding the TRM allowed out of service time requires an Operability Determination (OD) for the ECCS and RCIC systems. Failure to perform the OD is a condition prohibited by the TRM. The definition of Operability requires that support systems be functional. Since the cooling system did not meet the system performance criteria it was non-functional therefore the supported systems did not meet the definition of Operability. This results in a potential loss of safety function for the single train HPCI system.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
At 1200 CDT on May 13 2016 while the plant was operating at 100 percent power the shift manager was notified of a design inadequacy that could potentially prevent both divisions of the standby gas treatment system (GTS) from performing its design function. Under certain specific conditions the 480-volt circuit breakers supplying the GTS fans may not re-close following a trip signal. In the postulated condition in which a start signal is followed by an immediate (within 0.075 seconds) trip signal the breaker could fail to close at the next attempt. As a result of this condition both divisions of GTS were declared inoperable. The initial investigation of this condition determined that circuit breakers in the main control building air conditioning system (HVC) and the diesel generator building ventilation system (HVP) are also susceptible to this postulated failure mechanism. This defect has the potential to similarly cause the HVC and HVP systems to be incapable of performing their safety function. The affected circuit breakers in those systems have been modified to correct the deficiency. This condition is being reported as operations prohibited by Technical Specifications and an event that could have caused a loss of safety functions of the affected systems. The specific scenario in which this failure mechanism could plausibly have occurred is a highly unlikely event. Additionally standing orders were already in place at the time of this event that directed the operators to take compensatory actions to preserve the safety function of the affected systems. Those orders will remain in effect until all modifications are complete. Thus this condition does not represent a significant challenge to the health and safety of the public.,"['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
"This report is submitted pursuant to the 30 day Special Report requirement. The guidance provided in NURGEG 1022 Revision 3 allows the reporting to be combined. On November 25, 2014, AREVA NP Inc. notified Entergy Operations, Inc. of a deficiency in the Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1 (ANO-1) Emergency Core Cooling System evaluation model. When the deficiency is accounted for, the Large Break Loss-of-Coolant Accident Peak Clad Temperature was estimated to exceed 2200°F and the absolute value of the deficiency is greater than the requirement. Exceeding 2200°F resulted in ANO-1 making an 8-hour NRC notification on November 25, 2014. See Event Notification EN 50641.

"On December 7, 2011, Clinton Power Station (CPS) was in Mode 5 (Refueling) for refueling outage C1R13. During leakage testing of Reactor Coolant System Pressure Isolation Valve (PIV) 1E12-F042C, Low Pressure Coolant Injection from Residual Heat Removal C Shutoff Valve was performed in accordance with Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.4.6.1. This test was performed to address a missed surveillance that was discovered on April 7, 2011. During the test, the valve would not pressurize due to the amount of water passing through the seat at low pressure. The test pressure for the surveillance test is 1000 to 1025 pounds per square inch gauge. Since the valve would not pressurize, the leakage was determined to be in excess of the specified leakage criteria of five gallons per minute and was declared an as-found failure. The valve repair team identified wear on the guide ribs and excessive disc to rib clearances, which appeared to be original dimensional tolerances rather than recent wear. Engineering determined the cause of the as-found failure was that the disc became cocked during closing causing the valve to not fully seat. Corrective actions included repairing the valve and retesting the valve with satisfactory results.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"At 1302 hours Eastern Daylight Time on 10/08/2016 with the plant in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, H. B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant Unit No. 2 (HBRSEP2) experienced an automatic reactor trip due to a loss of off-site power (LOOP). This resulted in the loss of both main feed pumps (MFP) and subsequent autostart of both motor-driven auxiliary feedwater (AFW) pumps as designed. Coincident with the LOOP, both emergency diesel generators (EDG) automatically started and were providing power to the two vital 480V buses (E-1 and E-2), which power both AFW pumps. Once the power grid was stable, plant personnel commenced restoration of off-site power to allow shutdown of the EDGs. At approximately 2323 EDT on 10/08/2016, a second automatic actuation of the 'B' AFW pump occurred during the transfer of power from the 'B' EDG to off-site power due to improper breaker coordination that satisfied the auto-start logic for the AFW system. The apparent cause of the LOOP is a failed relay in the phase-to-phase portion of the line trip circuitry, which prevented the grid fault from being immediately isolated in the HBRSEP2 switchyard.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On July 5  2016  at 1640 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)  the Unit 2 High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) system was declared inoperable due to apparent failure of the HPCI Auxiliary Oil Pump. The HPCI Auxiliary Oil Pump provides hydraulic pressure required to open the HPCI Turbine Stop Valve and the HPCI Turbine Control Valve during initial HPCI startup. Failure of the HPCI Auxiliary Oil Pump prevents the HPCI system from performing its safety function. This condition is being reported as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of a system that is needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. The HPCI system inoperability was due to loss of control power for the Auxiliary Oil Pump. The loss of control power was caused by a failed motor overload alarm relay coil; which caused current flow in excess of the control power fuse rating. The HPCI system was restored on July 6  2016  at 1050 EDT. The alarm relay coil failure was age related. The corrective actions include creation of preventive maintenance tasks to replace the Unit 1 and 2 HPCI motor overload alarm relay coils on an appropriate frequency.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']
"On September 6 2012 at approximately 2300 the indication associated with feedwater flow transmitter FT-3-476 [JB:FT] was noted to be reading lower than expected. After further assessment on September 7 2012 at approximately 0540 the associated Reactor Protection System channel was declared inoperable and at approximately 0837 the channel was placed in the tripped condition. Troubleshooting determined the high and low side process tubing for the differential pressure transmitter was reversed. The tubing was repaired and FT-3-476 was returned to service at approximately 1100 on September 7 2012. The tubing reversal occurred when it was replaced during the recent refueling outage. The causes of this event are: The work order task description (WOTD) specified ""Skill-of-the-Craft"" leading to a failure to use or ineffective use of human error prevention tools and the post maintenance test did not provide for a positive method of tubing orientation verification after replacement. Corrective actions include addition of rule-based instructions in the WOTD. The event is reportable because FT-3-476 was inoperable for a time greater than allowed by Technical Specifications and the required actions were not taken. Because redundant and diverse reactor trip instrumentation was available the safety significance is very low.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On December 18, 2013, while operating at 100% power, two workers opened doors concurrently when entering a secondary containment access airlock. Both individuals realized that this was not allowed and closed their respective door; however, the result was a brief inoperability of secondary containment integrity. This resulted in an 8-hour reportable event. The Resident Inspector was notified, and Event Notification Number 49657 was made due to a condition at the time of discovery that prevented the fulfillment of the Secondary Containment safety function. The apparent cause of the event was determined to be excess strength of a permanent magnet on one of the doors. The monthly surveillance test will be revised to check the permanent magnet for proper adjustment and to adjust it as needed. This event did not result in a safety system functional failure. There were no radiological releases associated with this event.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']
"On February 28, 2013, at 1319, Nine Mile Point Unit 2 was operating at 100 percent power when the High Pressure Core Spray (HPCS) system pressure pump failed. At the time of the failure, the HPCS system was inoperable for planned maintenance. The HPCS system pressure pump failure was due to an electrical short caused by a turn-to-turn failure in the motor. The cause of this event was determined to be a turn-to-turn short in the motor winding, attributed to poor manufacturer quality of the original motor. Corrective actions include replacement of the failed motor with a rewound motor and development of a new replacement strategy for these types of motors. This report constitutes a Part 21 notification because the motor failure that initiated the event is attributed to a manufacturing deficiency.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']
At approximately 0918 hours on Tuesday December 12 2017 while operating in MODE 1 at approximately 18 percent power the Grand Gulf Nuclear Station (GGNS) experienced a loss of the Engineered Safety Features (ESF) Transformer 11 which was powering the Division 1 ESF bus. Subsequently the station experienced an automatic start of the Division 1 Emergency Diesel Generator and the partial isolation of the primary and secondary containment buildings. Both of these events were expected and as designed. The direct cause of ESF actuations was the loss of ESF Transformer 11. The cause of the transformer loss is under investigation at this time and this licensee event report will supplemented upon completion of GGNS's causal analysis. Additionally GGNS experienced an unrelated isolation of the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling System upon restoration of power. The isolation of the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling System did not result in a loss of safety function. The cause of this isolation is under investigation and will be documented in accordance with the GGNS corrective action program. This event is reportable to the NRC as an event or condition resulting in a valid actuation of a ESF system.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On May 22 2019 at 0233 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) Watts Bar Nuclear Plant Unit 2 reactor was manually tripped due to a failure of the Steam Generator (SG) number 2 Main Feedwater Regulating Valve (MFRV) during power ascension following a refueling outage. Concurrent with the reactor trip the Auxiliary Feedwater system actuated as designed. All Control and Shutdown rods fully inserted. All safety systems responded as designed. This event was caused by a defective actuator diaphragm that led to premature failure and subsequent loss of control of the SG 2 MFRV. Contributing to this event personnel missed an opportunity to identify the actuator diaphragm was defective during its replacement. Corrective actions include replacement of the defective diaphragm and revising the procedure for diaphragm inspection and installation.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On September 5, 2019, it was discovered that an Equipment Clearance Order (ECO) to replace a degraded containment isolation valve on the outside of the Reactor Containment Building (RCB) had an error that resulted in a violation of Technical Specifications. The ECO incorrectly opened a test connection between the containment wall and a containment isolation valve inside the RCB that was required to be closed for Technical Specification compliance. When the degraded containment isolation valve on the outside of containment was removed, a leakage path out of containment was established. This resulted in a loss of one of the three fission product barriers and a violation of two Technical Specifications. Once the ECO error was recognized, Operations corrected the valve lineup to bring Unit 2 back into compliance with Technical Specifications. The root cause of the event was personnel error related. The two Licensed Senior Reactor Operators involved in the technical review and approval of the ECO failed to recognize at-risk behaviors and apply appropriate human performance tools. Corrective actions planned include procedure changes, as well as modifications to the software that controls the ECO process.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
On June 29  2017 at 0857  VCSNS Unit 1 automatically tripped due to low Feedwater (FW) flow to the 'B' Steam Generator (SG). The trip was the result of a spurious closure of the Main FW to 'B' Steam Generator Flow Control Valve  IFV00488-FW. The Flow Control Valve's closure resulted in low SG level coincident with the low FW flow  which caused an automatic reactor trip. The plant trip response was normal. The cause of this event was determined to be the inadvertent closure of IFV00488-FW due to solenoid valve failure. The solenoid valve failure appears to be a result of an inadequate solder applied to the solenoid coil during the manufacturing process.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On January 31  2024  a steam leak was identified near the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) drain line steam trap. This issue was entered into the work management process. The steam leak was later noted as degraded on February 19  2024  and during a walkdown on February 22  2024  to support the work order for repair  a maintenance technician identified steam potentially coming from the piping between the HPCI steam trap and a HPCI downstream valve. As a result of this potential through-wall pipe leak  Operations declared HPCI inoperable at 1718 hours on February 22  2024  and entered the applicable Technical Specifications Condition. An eight-hour non-emergency event notification (EN 56989) was made to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The HPCI trap assembly (steam trap  outlet valve  and piping) was replaced and HPCI was returned to operable status at 2101 on February 24  2024.

The spurious start of this pump could overload the Emergency Diesel Generator associated with the shutdown board that powers the pump. Compensatory actions in the form of fire watches to mitigate this condition are in place in accordance with the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Fire Protection Report. The cause of this condition was identified as human performance errors by engineers. The corrective actions for this condition include implementing a modification to reconfigure the wiring of the eight affected RHRSW pumps to eliminate the potential of Emergency Diesel Generator overloading due to RHRSW pump auto start, and to conduct additional training of engineering personnel.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A)']"
"On September 19, 2012 Energy Northwest (EN) identified that both divisions of Residual Heat Removal (RHR) Shutdown Cooling (SDC) Reactor Vessel isolation valves were inappropriately made inoperable at the same time on multiple occasions in support of maintenance and surveillance testing during the 2011 refueling outage (R-20). This planned inoperability of the SDC isolation valves was performed using procedure SOP-RHR-SDC-BYPASS. SOP-RHR-SDC-BYPASS contains the specific steps for preventing the closure of each of the SDC isolation valves and the subsequent restoration steps. SOP-RHR-SDC-BYPASS did not contain guidance to allow both divisions SDC isolation valves to be inoperable at the same time. Since both divisions of SDC isolation valves were made inoperable without procedural guidance, this is being reported as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of systems that are needed to remove residual heat and to mitigate the consequences of an accident.

BVPS-2 was at approximately 90% power and in an end of cycle coast down. The Auxiliary Feedwater System automatically started as designed. The apparent cause was a premature failure of a Train A Solid State Protection System (SSPS) universal logic board (ULB) due to manufacturing defects with the solder joints which may have resulted in an intermittent loss of connection.

At 1514 EST on January 6  2016  while operating at 100 percent Reactor Thermal Power (RTP)  the East and West Turbine Bypass Valves (TBV) automatically opened as expected for 3 minutes and 32 seconds in response to the number one High Pressure Turbine Stop Valve (TSV) drifting from full open to 25 percent open due to an actuator malfunction. TBVs must remain shut while RTP is at or above 29.5 percent to consider all channels of the TSV closure and Turbine Control Valve (TCV) fast closure Reactor Protection System (RPS) functions operable. Reactor Operators lowered RTP to 91.0 percent and at 1518 EST the TBV automatically closed and the TSV closure and TCV fast closure RPS functions were no longer considered inoperable. The TSV closure and TCV fast closure RPS functions must be operable at or above 29.5 percent RTP. In this event  during the period of time while TBVs were open  reactor power was maintained above 91 percent and the RPS functions were confirmed to be enabled.

"The condition reported by this LER was an expected condition which was the result of planned activities in support of a routine refueling outage. As described in the LER the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) provided enforcement guidance applicable to boiling water reactor licensees that allows the reported condition.

On 01/26/2025 at 14:50 the Control Room Emergency Ventilation (CREV) Air Conditioning (AC) system was declared inoperable due to a trip of the Refrigeration Condensing Unit (RCU) feed breaker. Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.5 Condition A was entered at that time. Control Room operators discovered that the indicating light for the RCU was not lit. An operator was dispatched and found that the feed breaker had tripped. After post maintenance testing of the breaker TS 3.7.5 Condition A was exited on 02/07/2025 at 00:30. Initial troubleshooting narrowed down to two potential causes which include breaker failure and loose breaker wiring. The causal product identified a design vulnerability where a simultaneous failure of a pressure switch and time delay relay could also cause the issue.

During the Beaver Valley Power Station (BVPS) Unit 1 1R22 Refueling Outage a through wall defect was discovered during a planned visual examination of the Reactor Containment Building (RCB) steel liner. The BVPS Unit 1 containment design consists of an internal steel liner that is surrounded by reinforced concrete. Investigation and laboratory analysis determined that there were indications of two through wall penetrations with a possible third penetration slightly off-set from the second. The total combined area of the three penetrations was calculated to be 0.395 square inches. A visual inspection of 100 percent of the accessible liner area was completed. No additional significant indications of corrosion were identified. Prior to startup from 1R22 the RCB steel liner was repaired and tested satisfactory. The direct cause of this event was determined to be pitting type corrosion originating from foreign material introduced during the original construction of the containment wall. An evaluation determined that there is reasonable assurance that the containment was operable during the period of time that the plant was operated with the small areas of through wall corrosion on the steel liner. Therefore there was no loss of safety function and the safety significance is considered to be very low.

"On November 3 2012 at 0825 Nine Mile Point Unit 1 (NMP1) experienced an unexpected rise in reactor water level followed by a turbine trip and subsequent reactor scram on low Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) water level at 53 inches. During this sequence of events multiple separate and valid initiation signals for High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) occurred. The initial rise in RPV water level was caused by a failure in the Feedwater System three element control of reactor water level resulting in a maximum demand open signal being sent to the 11 Feedwater flow control valve (11 FCV). Subsequent-level transients were due to the failure of the 11 FCV to operate properly to control water level. The root causes of this event were selection of an inappropriate Preventive Maintenance (PM) strategy and not changing the PM program to test electronic components for end-of-life failure mechanisms. Corrective actions to address the root cause include replacement of the failed electronic components, revision of the PM program for the feedwater FCVs and revision to the electronic module refurbishment program to check transistors.

The penetration between the cable vault and the battery room has since been sealed watertight. Additionally, the drain line in the cable vault has been cleared of obstruction.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)']"
"On April 13, 2012, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) notified Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN) of a NRC-identified non-cited violation. This violation was formally issued in the NRC Integrated Inspection Report for BFN, dated April 27, 2012. The violation was issued due to BFN's failure to accurately maintain design control regarding single-failure assumptions for the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) and to perform sufficiently bounding analyses to ensure that the calculated maximum fuel element cladding temperature of 2200 degrees Fahrenheit would not be exceeded in the event of a small break Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). Due to this condition, there was a potential that the Peak Clad Temperature limit of fuel rods in BFN Units 2 and 3 could have been exceeded starting March 30, 2004 for BFN Unit 3 and April 16, 2005 for BFN Unit 2 and ending May 20, 2011. The cause of this condition was sufficient barriers were not in place to require the appropriate reviews for design document control associated with ECCS availability in a LOCA scenario. Corrective actions are established to correct the flawed barriers to prevent this condition.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B)']
"On 11/28/13 at 0258 hours the Control room received a Unit 2 interlock door alarm. Operations sent an equipment operator to investigate; and found a Radiation Protection Technician (RPT) and laborers in the area of the alarming interlock removing lead blankets. With the Surveillance Requirement 3.6.4.1.2 not met Secondary Containment was declared inoperable and Unit 3 entered into Technical Specifications 3.6.4.1 Condition A. The doors were closed and the Technical Specifications Condition was exited. The cause of this event was determined to be a failure to recognize a hazard while proceeding in the face of uncertainty. Specifically the RPT did not recognize that there was a change in plant conditions (i.e. the restoration of the X-Area as part of the Secondary Containment boundary) and decided that it was permissible to override the door interlocks by using an emergency manual push-button. As a result of this event, Radiation Protection will be reviewing the proper use of human performance tools and will be revising procedures to enhance the notifications made to the Radiation Protection Department.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']
During scheduled testing at the offsite testing facility the as-found lift setting for the pressurizer safety valve previously installed in Unit 2 at the 2RV200 location was measured outside the Technical Specification allowable values (valve lifted low). The valve had been installed during the 2015 Unit 2 refueling outage and was removed during the 2017 Unit 2 refueling outage for scheduled testing and maintenance. As scheduled a spare valve was installed during the 2017 refueling outage. The failed valve was disassembled and inspected at the offsite facility. The apparent cause of the pressurizer safety valve failure is due to setpoint drift. The valve was successfully re-certified for use at the plant in a future installation. Setpoint setting criteria were adjusted based on more recent operating experience (setpoint drifting low).,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
During a review of a draft D1/D2 Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) Room Electrical Component and Relay Cabinet Temperature Calculation a list was generated to determine all electrical components in the D1/D2 rooms. The D1/D2 Room Electrical Component and Relay Cabinet Temperature Calculation used Engineering Changes (EC) 19815 and 19915 as inputs for what devices should be evaluated. It was discovered that EC19815 and EC19915 did not address all components in the D1/D2 rooms. The purpose of EC19815 and EC19915 was to determine the maximum ambient temperature data for electrical components and use that information in Operability Recommendation (OPR) 01327157. OPR 01327157 uses the engineering evaluations to justify the assessed capability of the equipment in the D1/D2 rooms up to 130 degrees F. Investigation began into the temperature rating of the equipment that was not in EC19815 and EC19915. Preliminarily it has been determined that four (4) components have a rating of 120 degrees F. Based on an engineering analysis  D1/D2 would have been inoperable for 415 minutes on June 7  2011  36 minutes on July 2  2012  212 minutes July 4  2012  272 minutes July 6  2012  and 43 minutes on May 14  2013.

At 2036 on December 1 2015 James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) was operating at 100 percent power when differential pressure of the Secondary Containment exceeded a Technical Specification requirement. The requirement is for the Secondary Containment to have a >/= 0.25 inches of vacuum water gauge compared to the external environment. This event was caused by hardened grease in the operating mechanism of the motor starter contactor 71MCC-141-OB2. This led to a slow start of the above refuel floor Reactor Building exhaust fan 66FN-13B while the intake air supply fans were running. The exhaust fan started without Plant Operator action after approximately 60 seconds; however Reactor Building differential pressure exceeded 0.25 inches of vacuum water gauge for approximately 80 seconds. When Secondary Containment did not meet the Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement 3.6.4.1.1 for differential pressure the Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) was not met. Therefore Secondary Containment was Inoperable. Restoration of the LCO was completed within the allowed action completion time. This report is being submitted as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of safety function to control the release of radioactive material.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']
"On January 13, 2012, at approximately 1403 Central Standard Time (CST), the unit experienced an unplanned automatic shutdown from full power operations and a coincidental loss of offsite power. The 345-60 generator output breaker in the switchyard catastrophically failed (fault on 'C' phase), resulting in breaker operations and subsequent loss of the East 345 kV bus and a trip of the main turbine. Coincident with the loss of the East 345 kV bus, a rapid transfer of the non-safety buses from the Unit Auxiliary Transformer to the Startup Transformer occurred. After the rapid transfer, a 'B' phase differential relay trip on the Startup Transformer resulted in a loss of the West 345 kV bus and loss of offsite power. The turbine trip initiated a reactor trip. All control rods inserted into the core. All reactor coolant pumps tripped. Both diesel generators started and supplied power to the 4.16 kV engineered safety features buses. Control room operators initiated action per procedure EMG E-0, ""Reactor Trip or Safety Injection,"" and transitioned into EMG ES-02, ""Reactor Trip Response."" Subsequently, a natural circulation cooldown was performed to place the unit in Mode 5.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
"On 9/27/2024 at 0748 EDT with Unit 2 in Mode 1 at approximately 100% power, the reactor was manually tripped due to a loss of condenser vacuum. The trip was not complicated with all systems responding normally post-trip. The Unit 2 auxiliary feedwater system started automatically as expected. During tropical storm Helene, Catawba experienced water intrusion into the 2HTA switchgear room located in the service building. The wind driven rain saturated exposed service building block walls allowing water to migrate into the rooms, resulting in the de-energization of 2HTA which tripped all cooling tower fans on Unit 1 and Unit 2. The loss of all cooling tower fans degraded main condenser vacuum on both units. The Unit 2 reactor was manually tripped due to approaching the low condenser vacuum trip setpoint. Operations was able to stabilize Unit 1 at 32 percent power. There was no impact to the health and safety of the public.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"At 12:05 Eastern Daylight Time on March 24, 2020, with Unit 1 in Mode 1 at approximately 22% power, coming out of a refueling outage, a Technical Specification required shutdown was initiated due to increased drywell leakage. The reactor was shutdown in accordance with normal shutdown procedures. Reactor water level reached low level 1 (LL1) following the shutdown. Per design, the LL1 signal resulted in automatic actuation of the Primary Containment Isolation System with closure of Group 2, 6, and 8 isolation valves. The shutdown was uncomplicated and all control rods inserted as expected. The increased drywell leakage was a result of an intermediate-position failure of Safety Relief Valve '1F' in conjunction with opening of the associated vacuum breaker. The cause of this failure was determined to be susceptibility of the Target Rock two stage Safety Relief Valve design to fretting wear of the main disc stem to piston connection when the associated main body is subjected to a high number of cycles during testing, resulting in displacement of the piston and galling in the main body piston guide. Safety Relief Valve '1F' pilot and main valve were replaced and retested upon restart from the reactor shutdown. There was no impact on the health and safety of the public or plant personnel.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On May 26  2017  while performing the Automatic Depressurization System (ADS) quarterly surveillance the time delay on the ADS initiation timer relay was found outside of its technical specification allowable value of ≤ 115 seconds  as documented in the corrective action program. Inadequate preventative maintenance is identified as the likely causal factor resulting in degradation to the timing function for the ADS initiation timer relay. The causal analysis is ongoing and this licensee event report may be supplemented upon completion of this analysis. This event is reportable as a license event report (LER) in accordance with NUREG-1022  Section 3.2.2  because it was a ""condition prohibited by Technical Specifications."" No loss of safety function would have occurred for this condition.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
On September 25  2012 at the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant  during maintenance on 4160V 12-Bus ammeter switch  a 12-Bus lockout occurred removing power from 12 Reactor Feed Pump and 12 Reactor Recirculation pump. With both Main Feed Regulating Valves in auto  the level transient reached the Reactor Water Level Hi Hi setpoint (+48 inches). The Main Turbine and 11-Reactor Feed Pump tripped as designed and a Reactor scram occurred. The root cause was determined to be that fleet work management guidance does not require the appropriate level of detail needed to expose the potential impact when injecting energy into plant structures  systems  and components. Immediate corrective actions were to remove the test equipment and reset the 12-Bus lockout. Long-term corrective actions include revising the work management guidance to require the appropriate level of detail.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On October 24  2023  while at 0% power level and Mode 6 (refueling)  it was discovered that a Unit 2 pressurizer code safety valve (PSV)  which had been removed during the refueling outage (2R29) and shipped off-site for testing  failed its as-found lift pressure test. The PSV lifted above the Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.10 allowable lift setting value. Setpoint drift of the PSV is the most likely cause of the failure. It is likely that the PSV was outside of the TS limits longer than allowable by the Required Action Statement (15 minutes) during the previous operating cycle in all applicable modes of operation. The PSV was replaced during the October 2023 refueling outage.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
On September 22 2015 at 17:03 with James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant operating at 100 percent power the Emergency and Plant Information Computer (EPIC) indicated a spike in Secondary Containment (SC) differential pressure (d/P) during performance of a surveillance test associated with automatic isolation of SC and initiation of the Standby Gas Treatment System. Per the plant data systems SC d/P exceeded the Technical Specification (TS) allowed value and then immediately trended negative following auto-start of one of the trains of Standby Gas Treatment. The time period that SC d/P was greater than the TS allowed value is reportable as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. SC was operable following reestablishment of greater than or equal to 0.25 inches of water vacuum and remains operable. SC d/P excursions during transition from normal to isolation mode of the Reactor Building Ventilation (RBV) System are an expected condition and attributable to the design of the non-safety related RBV System. The cause of the SC d/P exceeding the TS allowed value has been determined not to be associated with a component failure or equipment malfunction. Similar reportable events were identified during preparation of this report. A comprehensive listing of these occurrences is included in the report.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']
"On May 14, 2018, Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant determined that the Saltwater subsystems on both Units 1 and 2 do not conform with the licensing basis for protection against a tornado generated missile. The Saltwater system header is vulnerable to a tornado missile that enters the Intake Structure through the watertight door IS-2. An extent of condition review did not identify any additional items that are non-conforming to the design basis for a tornado missile. Upon determination of the initial non-conformance for the Saltwater system subsystems, both Saltwater subsystems were declared inoperable for both Units. Compensatory measures were put in place and verified. Therefore, in accordance with the NRC Enforcement Guidance Memorandum EGM 15-002, both Saltwater system subsystems were returned to operable but non-conforming status and an 8-hour ENS Notification was made to the NRC.

"On January 19, 2017, a power supply that supports operation of one of two ventilation supply fans for the 2-A Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) failed. The Vogtle Electric Generating Plant (VEGP) Technical Specifications (TS) 3.8.3 Condition F requires that if a ventilation supply fan is inoperable, it must be restored within 14 days or the associated EDG must be declared inoperable. This condition was not identified by operators at the time of occurrence due to no failure indication being available. Therefore, the power supply was not repaired within the required completion time and the EDG should have been declared inoperable and TS 3.8.1. Condition B entered. On February 16, 2017, because the completion time for TS 3.8.1 Condition B expired, the unit should have been placed in Mode 3 within 6 hours and Mode 4 within 12 hours. These actions were not taken and Unit 2 operated in a condition prohibited by TS. On February 22, 2017, the second power supply failed on this EDG resulting in the second ventilation supply fan being inoperable. Because both power supplies and therefore both ventilation supply fans were inoperable, the required TS 3.8.3 action is to immediately declare the EDG inoperable. However, this condition was not identified by the operators since no failure indication is available. On March 8, 2017, the completion time expired and the unit operated in a condition prohibited by TS. During a monthly surveillance run on March 8, the EDG tachometer was discovered not working, the EDG was shut down, declared inoperable, and troubleshooting revealed the power supplies had failed.

"On June 7, 2012, FPL determined that the April 2, 2012, failure of the St. Lucie 1A2 emergency diesel generator (EDG) immersion heater pressure boundary was reportable. The most likely failure mode would have rendered the EDG inoperable for longer than its allowed outage time. The failure was attributed to procedural inadequacies during the fill and vent of the EDG following maintenance performed during the SL1-24 refueling outage. A contributing factor included inadequate chemistry procedures. Immediate corrective actions included replacement of the failed immersion heater and extent of condition electrical checks on all St. Lucie EDG immersion heaters.

"On October 8, 2012, at 2255, Point Beach Nuclear Plant (PBNP) Operators declared Unit 1 Containment INOPERABLE due to a Service Water (SW) leak into Containment. Unit 1 entered Technical Specification Action Conditions (TSAC) for LCO 3.6.1, Containment. These TSACs required restoring Containment to OPERABLE status within one hour, followed by MODE 3 in the next six hours and MODE 5 in 36 hours. The leak was found to be on the return piping for the B Train reactor cavity cooler and was isolated by shutting the containment isolation valves. The leak was stopped, as verified by local observation. Containment was then declared OPERABLE, and the TSACs were exited. The degraded pipe was repaired and returned to service on October 26, 2012. After the event, a question was raised relative to the use of the closed valves to re-establish an operable containment penetration with a closed system inside containment since the valves had not been leak rate tested.

"At approximately 13:21 on October 11, 2021, the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, Unit 2, experienced an automatic reactor scram due to a main turbine trip. All turbine bypass valves (TBVs) opened, as expected, to control reactor pressure but did not subsequently re-close. Troubleshooting identified Pressure Transmitter PT-20101B as the cause of the TBVs failure to re-close. To control reactor pressure, operators manually closed the four main steam isolation valves and utilized the main steam line drains and the High Pressure Coolant Injection System. Further analyses showed the Pressure Transmitter PT-20101B failure was caused by failure of the pressure transmitter root valve resulting from main steam line vibrations created by the scram. The root valve was previously modified; however, station personnel did not validate that the modification would perform properly in all plant operating conditions. To correct the condition, the failed valve was replaced and applicable procedures were updated. Based on failure information, it is likely that Pressure Transmitter PT-20101B was inoperable for longer than allowed by Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.8. There were no actual safety consequences associated with the described condition.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']

The upper containment inner door was determined to be inoperable while the air lock outer door was tagged-out for planned maintenance. A seal air system leak test performed on the air lock inner door on February 6, 2018, had been deemed satisfactory. The outer door was subsequently taken out of service for planned maintenance and, while the outer door was out of service, an additional review of the paperwork determined that the test on the inner door was actually unsatisfactory. TS 3.6.1.2 Condition C was entered at that time. Maintenance of the outer door was completed, the air lock was returned to operable status, and ACTION C was exited at 0835 on February 11, 2018, prior to exceeding the TS action completion time of 24 hours. The cause was determined to be human error in transcribing data and interpreting test results. Analyses of test results for inner doors demonstrated that in all cases the doors and air locks remained functional and capable of maintaining containment integrity in the event of an accident. The inner doors and the air locks remained functional, containment integrity was assured throughout the events, and there was no significant impact on the health and safety of the public.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']"

In this condition, the door is not able to perform the flood protection function. With no person in attendance, the door would not be shut to prevent internal flood water from entering the Unit 1 HPCI room. This condition would result in the inoperability of equipment in the room it is designed to protect from flooding. The construction of the adjacent Unit 1 and Unit 2 HPCI rooms provides no flood barrier between the two rooms. Therefore, a condition that results in flood protection being nonfunctional to one HPCI room also has an effect on the opposite Unit HPCI. The Unit 1 HPCI watertight door being found open, with no one in attendance, results in the unplanned inoperability of the Unit 2 HPCI, since the Unit 2 HPCI is required to be operable by Technical Specifications in Mode 1.

Specifically, SRV-3C was determined to be inoperable based on its on-demand performance at low reactor pressures, as well as the visual conditions that were identified during the inspection process. SRV-3A was considered inoperable based on it having similar internal indications as SRV-C when it was disassembled and inspected. SRV-3A was installed in May 2011 and SRV-3C was installed in October 2013. Additionally, during an extent of condition review of historical SRV performance, the review identified on March 13, 2015 that SRV-3A had failed to open in response to three manual actuation demands on February 9, 2013.

"At 06:53 Eastern Daylight Time with Shearon Harris Nuclear Power Plant Unit 1 in Mode 1 at sixteen percent power following the completion of a refueling outage an automatic reactor trip occurred due to an under-voltage condition on the 'A' reactor coolant pump (RCP) and the 'C' RCP that resulted from a loss of power from the 'A' auxiliary bus. Power was lost from the 'A' auxiliary bus while operators were performing a procedure to transfer power from the 'A' start-up transformer to the 'A' unit auxiliary transformer (UAT). With the loss of power from the 'A' auxiliary bus, the 'A' main feedwater pump (MFP) tripped. The 'B' MFP was not in service and with the loss of the last running MFP, the auxiliary feedwater system actuated as designed. Safety systems functioned as required. This event did not impact public health and safety. An investigation determined that the current transformers (CTs) in the '1A-3' cubicle were mis-wired, resulting in a differential current protective relay sensing the equivalent of a differential current in the 'C' phase on the 'A’ auxiliary bus. When current was applied through the 'A' UAT to the '1A-3' cubicle, the differential current protective relay actuated, which actuated the lockout of the 'A' auxiliary bus. The wiring error occurred during maintenance activities on the CTs that were reinstalled during the refueling outage. Corrective actions involved rewiring of the CTs in accordance with design.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"At 00:51 Eastern Daylight Time on 6/3/2024 with Oconee Nuclear Station Unit 3 in Mode 3 at 0 percent power an actuation of the emergency feedwater system (EFW) occurred as main steam (MS) pressure was being lowered as part of reactor coolant system cooldown for a planned shutdown. MS pressure was lowered below the actuation setpoint for the Automatic Feedwater Isolation System (AFIS) prior to bypassing AFIS resulting in the trip of the operating main feedwater pump and subsequent auto-start of the 3A and 3B motor-driven EFW pumps on the low steam generator level circuit. All systems operated as designed, no equipment failures occurred or contributed to the event, and there was no release of radioactive material to the environment. The cause of the event was a change to the unit shutdown procedure that did not include appropriate barriers to consistently prevent an inadvertent AFIS actuation. An additional cause for the event was inadequate oversight of operator monitoring of MS pressure and bypass of AFIS. Corrective actions include revising unit shutdown procedures to ensure barriers to AFIS actuation and improvements to operator and oversight training.

The feedwater isolation signal P-14 was automatically actuated at 18:43 when the 'B' SG level reached the setpoint of 90.8% narrow range level. The plant was being started up following the major work performed for Refueling Outage 18. No adverse consequences resulted from this event. Post-trip investigation revealed that FW-LT-502-V1L (the variable leg pressure isolation for FW-LT-502) had not been restored to the required open position during routine instrument line filling and venting. On April 26, 2017, I&C performed backfilling of the reference legs on multiple steam generator level channels, including FW-LT-502, the 'B' SG wide range level instrument. FW-LT-502-VIL not being restored to the open position caused the 'B' SG wide range indication to respond slowly to level changes resulting in overfeeding the 'B' steam generator. The cause of the event was determined to be failure of the I&C technician to properly implement maintenance fundamentals during the performance of restoration of FW-LT-502. Individual performance was corrected. A contributing cause was determined to be improper characterization of SG level backfill activity as skill-of-the-craft. Planned corrective actions include the development of a maintenance procedure to provide specific step-by-step instructions.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On March 27  2013  while in Mode 3 during startup from a refueling outage  an inadvertent safety injection (SI) occurred during reactor protection logic channel functional testing. The test procedure noted that pressurizer pressure must be above 1930 psig to perform the test but signals may be installed to simulate the condition. In accordance with Appendix A of the test  helipot installation is directed for four pressurizer (PZR) pressure channels to allow PZR pressure signals to be simulated. A helipot was first installed in PT-455 and then simulated pressure raised above 2000 psi. A second helipot was installed for PT-456 and simulated pressure was raised above 2000 psi. SI is automatically enabled with 2 channels above 1900 psig but one of the two out of three pressure signals remained below the 1720 psig signal required for SI actuation. During this time the plant is susceptible to an SI actuation if one of the inputted signals is lost. Before pressure could be simulated in the remaining transmitter PT-457  the test lead connected to PT-456 failed open causing the system to register a 2/3 PZR low pressure satisfying the logic for SI actuation. The root causes were 1) The test procedure did not contain steps to preclude a single point failure  2) Manufacturing defect of a test equipment lead  3) Insufficient evaluation of the risk of when the test was being performed. Corrective actions include removing the defective lead from service  inspecting and testing remaining leads. Procedure 3-PT-M13B will be revised to remove single point vulnerability. A Training Evaluation & Action Request will be initiated to create a Case Study for this event which will include information associated with performing in depth risk assessments when surveillance tests are added to or removed during an outage. A TEAR will incorporate the Study into operations training  and a review will be performed on acceptability of testing in Mode 3. The event had no significant effect on public health and safety.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
A modification was performed on the drywell unit coolers condensate flow rate monitoring system during the Spring 2015 refueling outage (2R13) due to obsolescence issues on the system. The modification replaced all six flow sensors and flow transmitters with a more recent design. The cause of the system inoperability has not yet been determined. Further troubleshooting will occur during the next drywell entry outage opportunity. The planned corrective action is to restore the system to an operable status. The degraded Unit 2 reactor coolant system leakage detection system will be restored to operable status during the next refueling outage.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On February 13, 2012, a review of NRC Information Notice (IN) 2012-01 (Seismic Considerations-Principally Issues Involving Tanks) determined there was a clarification in NRC's position regarding aligning non-seismic piping to the seismically qualified Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST). The IN identified failures by licensees to recognize that aligning non-seismic piping to the RWST would require Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) action statement entry or license amendments. Intentionally aligning the seismically qualified RWST piping to non-seismic Fuel Pool Purification System (FPPS) by opening a boundary valve can cause the RWST to become inoperable. TS LCO 3.0.2 requires that upon discovery of a failure to meet an LCO, the required actions of the associated conditions must be met. TS LCO 3.0.2 does not allow applying compensatory measures such as manual actions in place of a closed boundary valve for periods longer than the TS completion time for restoring the RWST to operable unless the TS expressly permit such operation. Indian Point unit 3 had performed a safety evaluation based on IN 97-78 that allowed operator action. IN 2012-01 clarifies that application of compensatory actions for periods longer than the TS completion time is not allowed. The apparent cause was historical interpretation. Original issue was resolved using the NRC guidance for operator manual actions. Corrective actions will include revision of system operating procedure 3-SOP-SI-003 to prevent aligning the RWST to the FPPS during applicable Modes until the issue is resolved, evaluate the feasibility of a license amendment to allow operator action, assessment of FPPS piping for upgrade to seismic. The event had no effect on public health and safety.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
During the Nine Mile Point Unit 1 forced outage which began on September 20  2012  the Shutdown Cooling (SDC) system was in service with both suction line isolation valves (IV 38-01 and IV 38-02) open and de-energized  in accordance with the system operating procedure. The purpose of this SDC system alignment is to prevent inadvertent or spurious interruption of the shutdown cooling decay heat removal function  and is in accordance with applicable Technical Specification requirements. However  following discussions on October 18  2012  a determination was made that this condition is reportable as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident  because both of the SDC system suction line isolation valves were incapable of closing in the event of a low-low reactor water level due to a leak in the SDC system. The cause of this event is attributed to the failure of Operations personnel to recognize the need for  or coordinate  reviews from other key station stakeholders when the SDC system operating procedure was revised to add instructions for defeating and restoring the SDC system isolation function. Corrective actions include deleting the subject instructions from the operating procedure and conducting additional licensed operator training regarding application of the reportability criteria.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']
"During the 2016 Unit 1 R27 refueling outage, plans were put in place to upgrade the 1B31-1RC-12BR-E-5 (1B31-E5) design weld overlay (WOL) to a full structural weld overlay (FSWOL) in order to allow for code qualified examinations. On February 16, 2016 at 0631 EST, during surface preparation work, axial indications were found on the WOL. Evaluation of the indications found in the weld overlay suggests that the non-satisfactory PT examination was a result of the propagation of the original flaw that was found on the 1E Recirculation Loop Piping. The original indication had propagated into the Inconel Alloy 82 WOL material installed in 1988. It was determined that the as-found condition of the flaw did not meet ASME Section XI acceptance criteria. The indications were removed from the WOL and 1B31-E5 was upgraded to a full structural weld overlay using intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGCSS) resistant Alloy 52 weld material.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A)']
On October 27  2018  at 1533 Eastern Daylight Time(EDT)  Watts Bar Nuclear Plant Unit 1 reactor was manually tripped due to the number 3 Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) normal feeder breaker failing to close during the planned power transfer to unit power following startup. Concurrent with the reactor trip  the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) system actuated as designed. All safety systems responded as designed. During the post trip investigation  it was discovered that the normal feeder breaker for the number 3 RCP was left in the racked down (disconnected) position. The apparent cause of this event was operations personnel failed to properly implement the requirements of system status control procedures. Corrective actions include revising the system operating instructions controlling the RCP normal feeder breaker position and implementing additional training on system status control.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On November 22, 2013, Hope Creek Generating Station (HCGS) received results of the 'as-found' setpoint testing for the safety relief valve (SRV) pilot stage assemblies. The results indicated that five SRV pilot stage assemblies' setpoints had exceeded the lift settings prescribed in the Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) for Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.2.1. The TS LCO requires the SRV lift settings to be within +/- 3% of the nominal setpoint value. All five of the valves failing to meet the limits were Target Rock Model 7567F two-stage SRVs. During the eighteenth refueling outage (H1R18) all 14 SRV pilot stage assemblies were removed and tested at an offsite test facility. A total of five of the 14 SRV pilot stage assemblies experienced setpoint drift outside of the TS 3.4.2.1 specified values. The cause of the setpoint drift for the five SRV pilot stage assemblies is attributed to corrosion bonding between the pilot disc and seating surfaces, which is consistent with industry experience. This conclusion is based on previous cause evaluations and the repetitive nature of this condition at HCGS and within the BWR industry. There was no actual safety consequence associated with this event.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On November 9, 2013, at 1514, Millstone Power Station Unit 2 (MPS2) experienced a turbine trip and an automatic reactor trip from 95% power MODE 1 due to loss of condenser vacuum. The Unit was in the process of condenser backwashing operations when condenser vacuum was lost due to unexpected pump ramp-down of the 'C' circulating water pump (CWP) when the 'D' CWP was secured as required by procedure. All control rods inserted on the reactor trip. An auxiliary feedwater (AFW) automatic start occurred post trip as expected per design, and all other safety systems functioned as required. The direct cause of the event was the MPS2 'C' CWP ramped off due to failure of contacts on a time-delay relay to deenergize as designed. The defective relay was replaced. Additional corrective actions are being taken in accordance with the station's corrective action program.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On July 6  2016  with the Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 2 Reactor operating in Mode 1 at 100 percent power  the control room received a report of a steam leak on the Unit 2 B Right Moisture Separator Reheater (MSR) crossover piping and damage to the turbine building structure. This information resulted in a decision by the crew to manually trip the Unit 2 Reactor at 0038. The cause of the steam leak was the sudden failure of the balance bellows on the Unit 2 B Right MSR crossover expansion joint  which also resulted in damage to the west wall of the turbine building. A Root Cause Evaluation of the bellows failure is in progress. A supplement to this Licensee Event Report with additional information will be submitted upon completion.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On November 20 2014 at 1248 hours the Byron Station Main Control Room (MCR) received an alarm identifying that fuel oil level was low on one of two Diesel Oil Storage Tanks (DOSTs) associated with the Unit 1 B-train (1B) Emergency Diesel Generator (DG). At 1328 hours the MCR received an alarm identifying level was also low in the second DOST associated with the 1B DG. Operators determined that the low level condition was due to leakage to the Unit 1 A-train (1A) fuel oil storage system through one of two 1A DOST inlet valves. The Corrective Action Program investigation identified that leakage initially occurred during the 1B DG monthly surveillance conducted on October 22 2014. Subsequent analysis concluded that the loss of inventory from the 1B DOSTs to the 1A DOSTs would result in the 1B DG not meeting its design mission time without operator intervention. The cause of the event was a degraded DOST inlet valve that allowed fuel to transfer from the 1B DOSTs to the 1A DOSTs.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
Between October 21-28 2013 workers on several occasions breached SQN Unit 1 containment penetration X-108 while performing plant maintenance during fuel movement. Technical Specification 3.9.4 Containment Building Penetrations requires that containment building penetrations providing direct access from the containment atmosphere to the outside atmosphere shall be closed during fuel movement. Workers were not aware that use of X-108 penetration was not allowed during movement of irradiated fuel. On October 27 2013 a Senior Reactor Operator identified penetration X-108 affecting the auxiliary building secondary containment enclosure (ABSCE) was breached without required compensatory measures. The penetration manual valves were subsequently closed and secured. The root cause is ineffective procedures for controlling containment penetration breaches during Modes 5 and 6. A governing procedure will be developed and implemented for controlling breaches of the shield building ABSCE control room boundaries and design basis flood barriers.,"['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
"On March 4, 2016 at 1235 Eastern Standard Time (EST), Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) 3 was declared inoperable. At this time, EDG 1, Emergency bus E1, and balance of plant (BOP) bus 1D were inoperable due to planned maintenance. Two inoperable EDGs represents a loss of safety function for the onsite standby power source. Therefore, this condition is being reported as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of a system that is needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. In addition, it was determined that EDG 3 was inoperable for greater than Technical Specifications (TSs) Completion Times. Therefore, this condition is also being reported as operation prohibited by the TSs. Additionally, on March 3 work was ongoing to restore power to BOP bus 1D when an error in the restoration sequence resulted in an invalid auto-start of EDGs 2 and 4. Because the invalid auto-starts of EDGs 2 and 4 are directly related to the events associated with this LER, it is being reported herein rather than the optional 60-day telephone notification. The root cause of the EDG 3 inoperability is a design vulnerability associated with relaxation of the EDG 3 fuse holder fingers which was not properly mitigated. The corrective action to prevent recurrence will be to implement a design change to address the vulnerability.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
"On March 13, 2013 at approximately 1120 with Unit 3 in Mode 3, the Auxiliary Feed Water (AFW) System actuated. Subsequently, at approximately 1131 operators initiated a manual reactor trip. Just prior to these events, one Condensate Pump (CP) and one Steam Generator Feed Pump (SGFP) were in operation when a field operator started a second SGFP for a one minute run to vent the supply header and casing. The plant is designed to only allow a single SGFP to operate with a single CP operating. This condition resulted in automatic trip of the running SGFP and AFW actuation. Operators then secured the just-started SGFP. AFW injected cooler water into the SGs reducing reactor coolant system temperature. Operators opened the reactor trip breakers via the manual reactor trip switch to obtain additional shut down margin, as a conservative measure. Operators started a Standby Steam Generator Feed Pump to maintain level in the SGs and secured both trains of AFW. The cause of the event is that licensed unit operators did not maintain adequate command and control of activities outside the control room allowing a decision to start the second SGFP to be made at the wrong organizational level. Corrective action will include implementation and assessment of the effectiveness of the improvement plan to reinforce operational standards.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On the morning of September 17, 2015, while operating at 100% power, workers opened doors concurrently when entering a secondary containment access airlock. The individuals involved each closed their respective doors upon encountering this unexpected condition; however, the result was a brief inoperability of secondary containment. This resulted in an 8 hour reportable event. The Resident Inspector was notified, and an Event Notification was made due to a condition at the time of discovery that prevented the fulfillment of the Secondary Containment safety function (Reference ENS 51405). Following the event, the doors functioned properly, and no deficiencies were noted with either door. There were no radiological releases associated with this event.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']
"During the February 2017 Unit 2 refueling outage two main steam safety relief valves (SRV) did not pass Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement 3.4.4.1 and Inservice Testing (IST) Program lift pressure requirements. Both SRVs (2B21-F013C and 2B21-F013L) lifted below their expected lift pressures. On February 16 2017 SRV 2B21-F013C was required to lift within plus or minus three percent of 1175 psi (i.e. 1175 psi plus or minus 35.2 psi) but actually lifted at 1131 psi. On February 17 2017 SRV 2B21-F013L was required to lift within plus or minus three percent of 1195 psi (i.e. 1195 psi plus or minus 35.8 psi) but actually lifted at 1130 psi. Both SRVs lifted prior to their expected lift pressures which is conservative in regards to maintaining reactor pressure vessel over-pressure limits. Both SRVs were replaced during the outage. A failure analysis was conducted; however, it did not identify a cause for the valves lifting below their expected lift set-points.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
On Monday  July 27  2015  Susquehanna experienced Reactor Building differential pressure less than 0.25 inches water column when a Secondary Containment boundary door (Door 104-R) was breached. As a result  Secondary Containment was declared inoperable and Susquehanna entered Technical Specification 3.6.4.1. This event was reported per the guidance of NUREG 1022  Revision 3  Section 3.2.7. The apparent cause involved a Unit Supervisor (Senior Reactor Operator) failing to follow the standard to verify the impacts of opening the 104-R door. The causal factor was that multiple work groups displayed a less than adequate questioning attitude and use of three-way communication. Planned corrective actions include General Employee Training (GET) changes  updating maintenance documents associated with the activity being performed when the door was breached  publishing a station communication associated with the event  changing out the lock to Door 104-R so that the lock differs from the lock to access the roof from other locations  and coaching the Unit Supervisor involved in this event.

"On September 13, 2016, and September 14, 2016, during plant walk downs by Engineering and the NRC Senior Resident inspector, pressurized fire protection piping in the Service Water Intake Structure was found to not be shielded against a Moderate Energy Line Break (MELB), resulting in inoperability of one train of Service Water for both units. During extent of condition walk downs conducted on October 6, 2016, and October 10, 2016, additional piping in the Unit 1 and Unit 2 Safeguards Buildings was found to not be shielded against a MELB, resulting in inoperability of one train of various safety related equipment for both units. The most likely cause of this event was the methodology used to conduct the initial MELB walk downs was flawed and allowed some MELB threats to be missed. Corrective actions include shielding the affected piping, performing a 100 percent walk down of rooms containing MELB piping identified for shielding, and revising the systems interaction program maintenance procedure. If additional reportable events are identified during completion of the ongoing extent of condition walk downs, a supplemental report will be submitted.

"The high differential pressure on the 2A1 DFS was the result of the incorrect installation of a debris backwash valve and internal binding of a flush-water check valve. The bound check valve caused a false low DFS transmitter differential pressure that prevented the DFS strainer from initiating a backwash and masked the problem with the debris backwash valve. To correct the problem, the debris backwash valve was properly reinstalled and the flush-water check valves associated with the DFS differential pressure transmitter were replaced with a more robust design.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On 12/7/12 with the plant in Mode 1 at 100% power, Service Water Cooling Tower level was discovered to be below the Technical Specification (TS) limit of 42.15 feet. Following discovery, a fast fill of the cooling tower was performed to restore water level above the TS limit. It was subsequently determined that cooling tower water level was below the TS limit for approximately 17 days. No adverse consequences resulted from this event and no safety system functional failure occurred since there was sufficient water in the cooling tower to maintain the cooling tower functional at all times. The cause of the event was failure to use diverse means to validate the accuracy of a potentially inaccurate cooling tower level indicator. Corrective actions included restoring level in the Service Water Cooling Tower and increasing the use of operator fundamentals.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On October 3, 2021, with Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP) Unit 2 in Cold Shutdown, the 22 Turbine Driven Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) Pump received a valid actuation signal. While performing the prerequisite checklists for Surveillance Procedure (SP) 2083A ""Unit 2 Integrated SI Test with a Simulated Loss of Offsite Power Train A,"" the Train B 22 Turbine Driven Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) Pump selector switch in the Main Control Room was placed in Shutdown Auto from Manual. This, combined with having the Non-Safety Related 4160 Volt buses 21 and 22 isolated for maintenance, completed the automatic start signal. The turbine and pump did not turn because the equipment was out of service with the steam supply valves closed. There was no impact on the ability to maintain safe shutdown conditions.

"On February 22, 2012 at approximately 1500, a linkage connector on the ""B"" Control Structure (CS) chiller that connects the compressor guide vanes to the guide vane motor was found broken. As a result, Operations declared ""B"" CS chiller inoperable and entered the appropriate Technical Specifications. On March 27, follow-up investigation into the guide vane failure determined that ""B"" CS chiller failed while the ""A"" CS chiller was out-of-service for maintenance. Consequently, both CS chillers were inoperable simultaneously. The direct cause of the connector failure was cyclic fatigue. The apparent cause was cyclic fatigue failure initiated / accelerated by corrosion of the ball-joint connector. The broken ball-joint connectors on the ""B"" CS chiller were replaced. Other key corrective actions that will be completed include: replacing the mechanical ball-joint connectors on the guide vane linkage on other applicable chillers, including replacement of the ball-joint connectors on the chiller guide vane linkage as a preventive maintenance activity for the ""B"" CS chiller and other applicable chillers, and completing a root cause analysis on chiller reliability.

"On February 20, 2014, following a review of a Pressurized Water Reactor Owners Group notification of a recent Non Cited Violation at another nuclear power plant, Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant (CNP) staff determined that CNP was in a similar circumstance of having been in an Operation or Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications (TS). At the end of each refueling outage, CNP draws a vacuum on the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) in order to refill the system. The RCS temperature and pressure (T/P) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) LCO 3.4.3 references two associated T/P operational limit figures, both of which terminate at a lowest pressure of 0 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). Therefore, operation at a vacuum is reportable in accordance with Operation or Condition Prohibited by TS. The apparent cause is that the screening for the original RCS vacuum fill procedures did not consider LCO 3.4.3 and its associated figures. The procedures have been put on administrative hold to preclude drawing a vacuum on the RCS until the LCO is revised to accommodate operation at a vacuum.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
A supervisor and two carpenters were transporting a loaded scaffold cart through an airlock from the refuel floor to the reactor enclosure when the cart bumped the inboard door crash bar which opened the door. The two carpenters and the cart were inside the airlock when both doors were opened. The airlock was closed in less than 10 seconds. This event resulted in a brief inoperability of reactor enclosure secondary containment integrity. The cause of the event was the failure of the human performance barrier regarding maintaining a questioning attitude. The failure occurred when the workers did not ensure the clearance between the cart and the crash bar was adequate. Also no barrier was used to prevent the cart contact with the crash bar. This event was not prevented by the design of the reactor enclosure airlocks since there is no mechanical interlock and the door open indicating light does not prevent simultaneous opening of both airlock doors. The airlock doors were closed to restore reactor enclosure secondary containment integrity. A work group stand down was conducted to reinforce the importance of hazard recognition and mitigation. The lessons learned were communicated to the site.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']
"On July 16, 2012, during operator rounds, a Service Water (SW) leak was discovered on a socket weld elbow of a three-quarter inch diameter sample pipe connected to the 31 Component Cooling Water (CCW) Heat Exchanger (Hx) SW discharge pipe upstream of sample valve SWN-49-1. The leak was too small to quantify. The leak is on a component classified as ASME Section XI Code Class 3. The weld leak was evaluated and determined not applicable to acceptance under Code Case N-513-3. The condition was determined to have no impact on SW cooling safety function. The affected SW header was declared inoperable and Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.9 (SW System) entered until the applicable CCW loop for the 31 CCW Hx was isolated. TS 3.7.8 (CCW System) was entered for one CCW loop inoperable. At the time this condition was identified the condition was not recognized as being reportable. The apparent cause was crevice corrosion due to exposure of unlined carbon steel to brackish SW (chloride) environment in low flow or stagnant vent/drain piping. The corrective action was a complete replacement of the affected piping assembly during the TS allowed outage time (AOT).

On May 2 2013 at 0845 B-train Emergency Gas Treatment System (EGTS) was removed from service for planned maintenance and Operations declared Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.6.9 not met and entered Condition A for one EGTS train inoperable. On May 3 2013 at 0111 the Main Control Room was notified that the A-A Auxiliary Air Compressor Air Dryer was not purging due to failure of the Auxiliary Control Air System (ACAS) A-A dryer central timing unit. Operations declared A-train ACAS and supported Technical Specification systems inoperable including A-train EGTS. WBN operations entered LCO 3.0.3 due to the inoperability of two trains of EGTS and began preparations to initiate an orderly shutdown within one hour. Operations initiated actions to restore B-train EGTS to standby in accordance with System Operating Instruction (SOI)-65.02 Emergency Gas Treatment System. At 0155 B-train EGTS was declared operable and the actions of LCO 3.0.3 exited. No action was taken to reduce reactor power while in LCO 3.0.3.

"On 5/11/12 at 1603 hours while operating at 100% power Unit 2 entered LCO 3.0.3 due to two control room floor cooling systems being inoperable. OV117A Control Room Floor Cooling Unit fan's discharge damper failed earlier during the same day at 0523 hours rendering the associated OV117A fan inoperable.

During application of a clearance order for repair of the failed OV117A fan damper the 'A' control room cooling fan switch was placed in 'Stop' position. This resulted in an automatic start of the 'A' Control Structure Chiller and all the associated 'A' fans except for the control room cooling fan and a shutdown of the 'B' train fans and chiller. This condition caused the loss of both control room cooling fans and LCO 3.7.3 ""Control Room Emergency Outside Air Supply (CREOAS) System"" Condition E; LCO 3.7.4 ""Control Room Floor Cooling System"" Condition D; LCO 3.0.3; TRO 3.7.9 ""Control Structure HVAC"" and TRO 3.8.6 ""Emergency Switchgear Room Cooling"" were entered at 1603 hours. The control room operators immediately recognized the loss of cooling and took manual action to restart the 'B' train. LCO 3.0.3 was exited at 1618 hours without a reactor power reduction. The causes of the event included a control switch design deficiency and less than adequate clearance order preparation review and application authorization. Immediate corrective actions were taken to modify alarm response procedures. Key corrective actions that are planned include replacing control switches to correct the design deficiency and revising the Susquehanna clearance order procedure to provide better guidance for developing clearance orders for equipment that is in an atypical configuration due to system transient. Susquehanna Unit 1 was in Mode 5 at the time of the event and therefore was unaffected because the associated Unit 1 Technical Specifications were not applicable. There were no adverse consequences to the health and safety of the public as a result of this event.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']
"On March 7, 2016, during a refueling outage, the control switch for the 21 Main Boiler Feedwater Pump (MBFP) was positioned to trip, and the 21 MBFP tripped as designed, but the MBFP discharge valve BFD-2-21 failed to fully close. MBFP discharge valve BFD-2-21 was declared inoperable, and Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.3 (Main Feedwater Isolation) Condition C (One or both MBFP discharge valves inoperable) was entered. Troubleshooting on the valve determined the close torque switch contact finger was out of position within the contact holder. This misalignment allowed the contact finger to move out of the proper position, causing Motor Operated Valve (MOV) BFD-2-21 to fail to close. The direct cause was valve BFD-2-21 close torque switch being out of position. The apparent cause was the MOV preventive maintenance procedure lacked the level of detail and direction to provide the appropriate guidance to recognize the susceptibility associated with the orientation of the close torque switch contact finger bracket opening and spreading of the ""U"" shape bracket. Corrective actions included replacement of the defective torque switch, inspection, and testing. A case study from this event will be developed and included in the continual ESP training. The adequacy of the guidance on work instruction on the arrangement/alignment of the contact ""U"" shape brackets will be evaluated, and the necessary guidance provided. The event had no significant effect on public health and safety.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On April 14, 2018 at approximately 1040 EDT, a reactor scram on low reactor water level occurred due to a partial loss of feedwater accompanied by a reactor recirculation system scoop tube lock. The High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) systems automatically started in order to restore reactor water level as designed. Reactor water level was subsequently maintained using RCIC. No Safety Relief Valves actuated and the Primary Containment Isolation System responded as expected. The partial loss of feedwater and scoop tube lock were caused by a loss of Division 1 electrical power which occurred following a trip of the normal feed to Transformer 64, the 13.8 kV Bus 11 Position D breaker. Division 1 Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs), EDG-11 and EDG-12, automatically started and energized Division 1 buses. In addition, both Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) subsystems were declared inoperable while aligned to their alternate power source following loss of their normal power source. The LPCI subsystems were declared operable following realignment to their normal source after EDG-11 and EDG-12 were started. Investigation has determined the direct cause of this event to be moisture intrusion into the A6 cubicle of the Bus 1-2B enclosure, which caused a ground fault that tripped the Bus 11 Position D breaker. Immediate corrective actions were completed to eliminate moisture intrusion into the Bus 1-2B enclosure. The root cause evaluation determined that the organization failed to recognize the degradation of the Bus 1-2B enclosure as a failure mechanism of the A6 switchgear. Corrective actions to prevent recurrence include developing and implementing a Preventive Maintenance strategy for outdoor metal clad switchgear.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
"On June 16, 2023, unit 1 was operating at 100% power. At 18:22, the 1B Main Feedwater Pump (MFP) began indicating oscillating speed. The oscillations increased in severity and became unresponsive to manual control input. Due to the loss of control, the 1B MFP was manually tripped as it approached the overspeed setpoints. Following the manual trip of the 1B MFP, the Unit responded with an automatic runback to 700MWe. Following the runback, the combined effects of the entire transient resulted in an automatic reactor trip due to Steam Generator #4 Lo-Lo water level. The direct cause of this event was a degraded servo on the 1B MFP. Vendor analysis of the component did not identify a specific failure mechanism and the cause is inconclusive. Based on engineering evaluation, the most probable cause is particulate accumulation in the servo valve due to historical water intrusion events into the 1B lube oil system. An additional supplement will be submitted if further analysis has more conclusive results. Corrective action included replacement of the servo. This LER is a supplement to the original LER 23-001-00 submitted on 8/15/2023. All times are in Central Daylight Time (CDT).",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"At approximately 1351 hours on Wednesday, December 12, 2018, while operating in MODE 1 at approximately 100 percent power, the Grand Gulf Nuclear Station was manually shutdown in response to Main Steam Bypass Stop and Control Valve A drifting open. The Main Steam Line Isolation Valves were manually closed as a mitigating action to control reactor pressure vessel rate of depressurization and cooldown. During the scram recovery, the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) System injection was delayed. During preparation to initiate High Pressure Core Spray (HPCS) System the operator noted that RCIC had started to inject but due to the water level and the rate of change the operator started HPCS. HPCS was secured once water level was trending higher. RCIC was utilized for reactor water level control until RCIC was placed in standby at 1645 hours. There were no consequences to the general safety of the public, nuclear safety, industrial safety and radiological safety for this event. The direct cause of the condition is a failed linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) in the actuator for the Main Steam Bypass Stop and Control Valve A. The cause of the event was the existing operating guidance for the turbine electro hydraulic control (EHC) did not provide procedural steps to manually swap from a faulty controller to an auxiliary controller, which would have allowed the operators to close the valve. Corrective actions included swapping wiring from the failed LVDT to an installed spare LVDT and enhancement of the procedural guidance to ensure operators have the tools to manually swap from a faulty controller to an auxiliary controller.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On February 17, 2013, while Unit 2 was in Mode 3 during a refueling outage, a pinhole leak was identified at the upper packing leakoff line cap seal weld of pressurizer spray valve 2CV-100F, which constituted a Reactor Coolant System pressure boundary leak. The Technical Specifications limit Reactor Coolant System pressure boundary leakage to zero. Based on visual inspection performed during the boric acid walkdown, the leak most likely existed during plant operation. The most likely cause of the pinhole was a latent weld defect created during the installation of the cap seal weld. A similar event is documented in Licensee Event Report 318/2010-002. The most likely cause for that event was a latent weld defect created during manufacture. The valve bonnet assembly, which includes the packing leakoff line, was replaced and inspected satisfactorily prior to startup from the Unit 2 refueling outage.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A)']"
On September 4  2013  personnel at Waterford 3 determined that the manual operator for a safety related air operated temperature control valve (ACC-126A) could not perform a full manual closure of the valve. Automatic operation was not affected. Manual closure is credited in safety analysis to preserve wet cooling tower inventory as part of the ultimate heat sink. The causal review determined that the cause  misalignment of the valve disc to the shaft  had occurred during planned maintenance in July of 2012. During this term of past inoperability  required systems and components in the redundant safety train were also inoperable for short periods of time for surveillance and planned maintenance reasons. The valve was repaired  retested successfully  and declared operable on September 5  2013. There was no impact to nuclear safety due to this condition.,"['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B)']"
"On August 26, 2020, Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant (PINGP) Unit 1 reactor automatically tripped on a spurious Power Range Negative Rate trip signal. Surveillance testing was in progress on the Nuclear Instrumentation System (NIS) Power Range Channel which placed one of the Neutron Flux Power Range bistables in trip, reducing the normal two-out-of-four trip logic to one-out-of-three trip logic. There were no nuclear safety impacts. The system operated as designed and initiated an automatic reactor trip that placed the plant in a safe condition. All systems responded normally. Operations stabilized the plant without complication. The direct cause of this event was attributed to a spurious negative rate signal of 1N41 Reactor Trip bistable during NIS Power Range Channel Calibration surveillance testing. The corrective actions include replacement of 1N41 components as well as a design modification.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
During the February 2015 Unit 2 refueling outage L2R15 two main steam safety relief valves (SRV) did not pass Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement 3.4.4.1 and Inservice Testing Program lift pressure requirements. Both SRVs lifted below their expected lift pressures. SRV 2B21-F013S was required to lift within plus or minus three percent of 1150 psi (i.e. 1150 psi plus or minus 34.5 psi) and actually lifted at 1099 psi.

"On March 1, 2018, with Units 1 and 2 operating at 100% power, during evaluation of safe shutdown equipment for protection from the damaging effects of tornado missiles, Point Beach personnel initiated a condition report documenting a potential vulnerability for the turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pumps due to steam supply piping that is not routed through a Class I structure. Operations declared the affected equipment inoperable, implemented Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 15-002, Enforcement Discretion for Tornado-Generated Missile Protection Noncompliance, Revision 1, and the required compensatory measures; and returned the equipment to an operable-but-nonconforming status. Subsequent to the condition identified on March 1, 2018, an extent of condition review documented additional equipment not fully protected by Class I structures that are potentially vulnerable to tornado missiles. The additional equipment was declared inoperable and returned to an operable-but-nonconforming status using EGM 15-002, Revision 1.

On 03/09/24 at 2126 CST train 'C' Essential Cooling Water and cascading equipment were declared inoperable due to a through-wall leak on Essential Cooling Water Pump 1C discharge vent line. On 03/10/24 at 0353 CDT train 'B' Essential Chilled Water and cascading equipment were declared inoperable due to chilled water outlet temperature exceeding limits. This condition resulted in an inoperable condition on two out of the three safety trains for the accident mitigation function. The Essential Cooling Water 'C' train inoperability cause was due to erosion of the pipe material resulting from aggressive flow due to pipe geometry. The Essential Chilled Water 'B' train inoperability cause was indeterminate.

"On August 15, 2013, at 18:24 PDT, Pacific Gas and Electric lost the 230 kV offsite power source to its Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 1 when the Startup Transformer (SUT) 1-1 load tap changer (LTC) diverter switch failed. This resulted in the valid start of all three Unit 1 emergency diesel generators (EDGs). The EDGs successfully started but did not load because the associated buses remained energized by the 500 kV auxiliary offsite power source. On August 16, 2013, at 02:36 EDT, DCPP made an 8-hour report to the NRC (NRC Event Notification Number 49287). A failed bolted connection between a flex link and a stationary contact caused the SUT LTC diverter switch to fail. It was determined that the bolted connection failed because the vendor did not adequately torque the connection during assembly and installation.

The As-Found test results for eleven Safety/Relief Valve (S/RV) pilot assemblies during the 2022 Refueling Outage at James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) identified five (5) S/RV pilot assemblies that lifted outside of the allowable tolerance required by Technical Specifications (TS) Surveillance Requirement 3.4.3.1. Five (5) three-stage S/RVs were found out of tolerance low. Therefore the TS inoperability of the five (5) S/RVs resulted in a reportable condition. This condition did not affect the S/RV safety function to relieve vessel overpressure in accordance with the transient analysis. A low lift setpoint reduces the margin for inadvertent SRV actuation. The failed S/RV were replaced during the outage. An investigation into the cause of this condition is ongoing and a supplement report will be submitted.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']

"On September 8, 2021, while Unit 1 was at 100% rated thermal power, the High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) pump discharge isolation valve was stroked closed as a part of a valve surveillance activity. Up to this point, HPCI was operable. When the valve was given an open signal, the valve did not return to the open position. Without the ability to open this valve, HPCI is inoperable. Systematic troubleshooting determined that the pinion gear key in the valve actuator had not been properly staked during previous maintenance activities in 2006, leading to the key moving and the pinion gear disengaging from the actuator motor shaft. This caused the valve to become inoperable, not allowing it to stroke to the open position. As a corrective action, the pinion gear key was properly staked per procedure to the actuator motor shaft and the pinion gear reinstalled.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']
"On July 8, 2015, during surveillance testing, the Control Room received a 6.9kV motor trip alarm due to 31 Condensate Pump (CP) Motor circuit breaker trip on overcurrent. Operators entered Alarm Operating Procedure 3-AOP-FW-1 due to loss of the 31 CP and initiated a load reduction. During this time the Main Boiler Feedwater Pump (MBFP) suction pressure decreased to its suction pressure cutback controller pressure range and its output decreased MBFP speed control to a minimum. The 31 MBFP speed control signal locked in at this minimum speed signal due to actuation of the MBFP Lovejoy speed control system Track and Hold feature. Due to this minimum 31 MBFP condition, the 31 MBFP recirculation valve opened causing the 31 MBFP check valve to close. With the 31 MBFP unloaded, Steam Generator (SG) water levels decreased and at 15 percent operators manually tripped the reactor. The Auxiliary Feedwater System automatically started as expected due to SG low level from shrink effect. Direct cause was the 31 MBFP entered a Hold condition erroneously due to a miss-wired Track and Hold board in the speed control system. The root cause was the procurement for the MBFP Lovejoy Track and Hold boards was at an insufficient quality level commensurate with its criticality. There was a failure to mandate functional testing and wiring verification requirements on the vendor to ensure the procurement of a quality product. Corrective actions included replacement of MBFP track and hold board and 31 CP motor. A new replacement Track and Hold circuit board for both the 31 and 32 MBFP speed control system with the miss-wiring corrected was installed.

On October 11  2011  following completion of a 2 year inspection/overhaul of the Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFWS) nitrogen backup (BU) supply pressure regulator (IA-PCV-1276)  the set pressure was increased to the set pressure of relief valve RV-1284 while performing the post maintenance (PM) test (PMT). RV-1284 lifted  chattered and the disc and seat were damaged. When valve PCV-1276 was returned to service  RV-1284 was found to be leaking and the system was isolated which resulted in the unavailability of the AFWS nitrogen BU system. An assessment was conducted on required actions as a result of isolating nitrogen BU. At 18:30 hours  a dedicated operator was stationed in the Auxiliary Boiler Feed Pump building for manual operation of the AFWPs discharge flow control valves (FCV) to mitigate any events that could result in loss of the normal instrument air (IA) supply. Under Design Basis Accident (DBA) events  the IA system (IAS) is not credited as its function to supply AFWS valves is not classified as safety related. Without IA  the BU nitrogen system is relied upon to operate the AFWS including the AFWP FCVs. When the AFWS nitrogen BU is unavailable  a dedicated operator is required to manually operate the AFWPs FCVs. The direct cause of the unavailable nitrogen BU was RV- 1284 chattering due to inadequate PMT work order (WO) instructions for control of air regulator set-pressure following overhaul. The apparent cause of operators not recognizing the need to station an operator locally prior to isolating the AFWP nitrogen BU supply was inadequate procedural basis and licensing bases documents (UFSAR  TS Basis  TRM) from a missed opportunity from a previous event. Corrective actions include RV-1284 replacement  revision of model PMT WOs with guidance on regulator set pressures  revision of TS Basis  TRM  UFSAR  DBD  applicable System Descriptions  Operations procedures and lesson plans. The event had no significant effect on public health and safety.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)']

The As-Found set pressure testing acceptance criterion for operability is 2485 +/-3%. The SVs were removed during the last refueling outage (RO) in the spring of 2015 and sent offsite for testing. Testing was performed within one year of removal as required by the Inservice Testing Program. SV RC-PCV-464 lifted at 2573 psig and SV RC-PCV-468 lifted at 2379 psig, which is outside their set pressure range. The remaining SV tested satisfactorily. All three SVs were found with zero seat leakage. During the RO, all three SVs were removed and replaced with certified pre-tested spare SVs. The SVs installed during the RO were As-Left tested to 2485 +/-1% with zero seat leakage in accordance with procedure 3-PT-R5A.

The valve is located in the common discharge header of both LPSI trains so if the valve went shut it would prevent both LPSI trains from performing their safety function. The method previously used to remove power from the valve was to isolate the electric signal going to the valve's current to pneumatic transducer with a key switch from the Control Room. It was determined that this method did not fully remove power to the valve operator. Apparent causes involved technical inaccuracies/omission of relevant information and document changes completed with inadequate reviews and documentation during the 1970s. Since the method did not fully accomplish the Surveillance Requirement, the associated Limiting Condition for Operation was not met. Since this condition unknowingly existed, Required Actions were not taken which placed both units in a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. In December 2011, Calvert Cliffs switched to locking shut the instrument air valve leading to the valve positioner as the method to ensure power is removed to the valve operator.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On June 12, 2017, during scheduled diesel generator (DG) maintenance, a crack was discovered in the epoxy along the seating surface of the Unit 3 3C DG Building access door. As a result of the condition, additional seal deficiencies were revealed on Units 1 and 2 (A, B, C, D) DG Building access doors and Unit 3 (3A, 3B, and 3D) DG Building access doors. The conditions identified affect the leak tight integrity of the outer doors. Leakage past these doors could result in flooding of DG rooms and prevent the Units 1, 2, and 3 DGs from performing their intended safety design function during a Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) event. The above resulted in an unanalyzed condition with DGs resulting in the potential to significantly degrade plant safety. Interim compensatory actions were established to restore access door integrity for the PMF event. Testing and evaluation are ongoing to analyze the condition. These results will be provided in a supplement to this Licensee Event Report.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B)']
On April 02  2022  during Local Leak Rate Testing (LLRT) conducted during the Unit 1 refueling outage  as-found leakage through the inboard Main Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV) (HV141F022B) was 227.0 standard cubic feet per hour (scfh) which exceeded the Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement (TS SR) 3.6.1.3.12 limit of 100 scfh for individual valve leakage. Based on cause  there is evidence that the condition existed during the last operating cycle for longer than allowed by TS 3.6.1.3. HV141F022B LLRT failure was caused by normal wear consisting of material deposit on the seating surfaces and low spots on the main poppet seat. Repairs to the valve resulted in an acceptable as-left LLRT value. Additionally  further review identified that procedure changes should be made to better define criteria for leadership challenge when step changes in performance are noted; corrective actions are established to revise Leakage Rate Test Program procedure. There were no actual consequences to the health and safety of the public as a result of this event.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"At 16:25 Eastern Standard Time on 2/13/2022 with Oconee Nuclear Station (ONS) Unit 2 in Mode 3 at 0 percent power and plant heat up to normal operating temperature in progress an actuation of the Emergency Feedwater (EFW) system occurred. The 2A and 2B motor driven Emergency Feedwater (MDEFW) pumps automatically started as designed when the ""low steam generator level"" signal was received for the 2A and 2B Steam Generators (SG). The 2A Main Feedwater (FDW) pump speed controller failed to raise pump speed as Main Steam (MS) system pressure increased during plant heat up. A fault state in the 2A FDW pump speed controls prevented the pump from responding to demand inputs from the Integrated Control System resulting in the pump operating at a constant speed. Following reset of the 2A FDW pump speed controls, the MDEFW pumps were secured, and Unit 2 startup was resumed. Procedure improvements were identified to include specific checks for FDW pump speed control faults prior to placing each FDW pump in service. Units 1 and 3 were not affected by this event. This event was reported to the NRC on March 23, 2022, in Event Notification (EN) number 55800.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On November 22  2024 at 1937 EST  with Unit 1 defueled and Unit 2 at 100% rated thermal power  it was discovered that both trains of the Control Room Emergency Air Temperature Control System (CREATCS) were simultaneously inoperable. This condition occurred when the B-B Main Control Room (MCR) chiller tripped on high gas discharge pressure due to a malfunctioning automatic water temperature control valve (TCV) while the A train of CREATCS had been previously declared inoperable. The B train of CREATCS was later restored at 0130 EST on November 23  2024 following implementation of compensatory measures that included manually controlling cooling water to the B-B MCR chiller. The applicable technical specification (TS) limiting conditions for operability (LCO) were entered for less than six hours as a result. This condition is being reported as a condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']
On October 6 2020 while in Mode 1 at 95% power level it was discovered that a Unit 2 Main Steam Safety Valve (MSSV) failed its as-found lift pressure test. The MSSV lifted below the Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.1 allowable lift setting value. Setpoint drift due to spring relaxation is the most likely cause of the MSSV failure. It is likely that the MSSV was outside of the TS limits longer than the allowable completion times for the associated Required Action Statements during the operating cycle in all applicable modes of operation. Therefore this condition is being reported as a condition prohibited by TS. The MSSV setpoint was adjusted to within the TS limits and returned to service restoring compliance. The MSSV that failed the surveillance setpoint test was replaced with a refurbished valve during the 2R27 refueling outage and sent to vendor for analysis.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
On November 20  2014  at approximately 1022 CST  during Containment closeout inspection  a Cooling Water (CL) Leak was identified on the lower face on the northwest corner on 14 Containment Fan Coil Unit (FCU) gasket. Unit 1 Containment was declared inoperable for a loss of Containment integrity  that required entry into Technical Specifications (TS) LCO 3.6.1 Condition A  Containment inoperable  in Modes 1  2  3  and 4. The causal evaluation determined that the 45 ft-lbs torque value chosen by the Root Cause Evaluation (RCE) Team using a risk-based approach resulted in allowable torque margin to stop leakage post-maintenance but did not prevent leakage from occurring on 14 Containment FCU.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']
"On October 3, 2017 at 0800 PDT, Secondary Containment (Reactor Building) became inoperable due to pressure increasing above the Technical Specification (TS) limit of -0.25 inches of water gauge (inwg). While the plant was at 100% power  a Reactor Building exhaust valve unexpectedly closed  resulting in a loss of Secondary Containment for approximately two minutes. Secondary Containment was declared inoperable and TS Action Statement 3.6.4.1.A was entered. The Control Room operators reopened the Reactor Building exhaust valve and pressure returned to within limits automatically. Secondary Containment was declared operable at 0810 PDT and TS Action Statement 3.6.4.1.A was exited. The apparent cause of the event is a surface degradation on the lower stab of an electrical disconnect causing a momentary high resistance when the cubicle door is opened. This event occurred during performance of thermography in the cubicle.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
"On June 8, 2013 at 08:40 PDT, with Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 2 in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) 2-3 failed to complete a scheduled surveillance run. Cyclic fatigue failure of a wire lug in the EDG 2-3 current differential protection circuit caused an automatic EDG shut down 21 hours and 42 minutes into the 24-hour load run. DCPP determined the last time EDG 2-3 would have been able to complete its 24-hour surveillance run was greater than the technical specification allowed outage time. Additionally, during the time that EDG 2-3 was unable to complete its load run, EDGs 2-1 and 2-2 also had been declared inoperable on several occasions. DCPP determined that a vibrating terminal block cover induced cyclical fatigue in the wire lug, causing it to fail. DCPP replaced the broken wire lug and permanently removed the cover. Additionally, DCPP will revise a procedure to periodically inspect for wear on the wires and lugs. This condition did not adversely affect the health and safety of the public.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
On October 5  2012 with Unit 1 in Mode 5 and the residual heat removal (RHR) system in service for reactor coolant system temperature control  activities were in progress in preparation for Mode 4 entry. One of the activities involved restoration of the steam generator level RPS/ESFAS instrumentation from a bypassed condition to normal alignment. During the restoration a steam generator lo-lo level actuation was received and the motor-driven auxiliary feed water (AFW) pumps started and two turbine-driven AFW discharge valves stroked full open. The AFW system had previously been removed from service per the controlling unit operating procedure; however  following safety system testing during the outage the AFW system was not properly aligned to prevent inadvertent actuations. Neither the safety of the plant nor public health and safety were affected by this event.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On 10/09/17 during the bi-weekly Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) #2 Load Test a Generator Lockout signal (86G) was received which tripped the EDG output breaker. This failure resulted in EDG #2 being declared inoperable and entry into an unplanned 7-day Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) at 0312. Troubleshooting identified a broken electrical ring lug connector on a current transformer that provides an input to the protective relay logic. The investigation determined the connector failure was due to fatigue cracking that was initiated by stresses caused by bending and twisting of the electrical lug beyond limits specified in industry guidelines. The ring lug was most likely distressed during initial installation in the 1990's. The condition that led to the EDG #2 trip existed for greater than the allowed outage time in the plant's Technical Specification (TS).,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
On April 18 2024 while at 0% power level and defueled it was discovered that a Unit 1 pressurizer safety valve (PSV) which had been removed during the April 2024 refueling outage (1R32) and shipped off-site for testing failed its as-found lift pressure test. The PSV lifted above the Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.10 allowable lift setting value. Setpoint drift is the cause of the PSV failure. It is likely that the PSV was outside of the TS limits longer than the allowable completion times for the associated required action statements during the previous operating cycle in all applicable modes of operation. The PSV was replaced during the April 2024 refueling outage.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
On January 25  2012 at 0033 hours  with Surry Power Station Units 1 and 2 at 100% power  oil foaming was observed in the Unit 1B Charging (CH) pump gearbox sight glass. The pump was secured and oil level verified. On January 31  2012  the 1B CH pump was started and within 30 seconds  foaming was again observed. On February 1  2012 at 1410 hours  the 1B CH pump was declared inoperable. Air ingress was considered to be the cause and oil pump suction line fittings were tightened and sealed. The pump was started on February 4  2012 with no foaming observed. Technical Specifications (TS) require one flow path of charging to be in operation with an additional CH pump to be operable when the reactor is critical. The TS limiting condition for operation (LCO) for one of the two CH pumps being inoperable is 72 hours. Without supporting information about the foaming  CH pump 1B was considered inoperable from January 25  2012  when oil could not be defined in the sight glass due to foaming  until the charging pump was declared inoperable on February 1  2012  exceeding the 72 hour LCO. Therefore  this report is being submitted pursuant to any operation or condition prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications. This event was determined to be of very low safety significance and the inoperable pump did not affect the health and safety of the public.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On Tuesday, March 7, 2017 at 2258 CDT, an Equipment Operator detected a relay cycling every 10 seconds from the Division (Div.) 1 480V Unit Substation (Sub) 1A. Agastat Time Delay Relay (TDR) 427X2-41A (X2 relay) was determined to be the source of the clicking sound. The X2 relay supports the undervoltage load shed and restoration of the Div. 1 Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) ventilation room fan 1VD01CA. The logic is designed to shed 1VD01CA on undervoltage, prevent it from restarting, then allow it to be restored 10 seconds after voltage is restored either by the EDG or return of the safety bus. An investigation of the relay cycling condition determined that 1VD01CA was unable to respond to a demand signal and the cycling was the effect of interaction between the X2 and 427X3-41A (X3) relays. As a result, Div. 1 EDG was declared inoperable on March 9. With the Div. 2 Residual Heat Removal (RHR) System already inoperable due to scheduled maintenance, the plant was determined to be in an unanalyzed condition. A causal analysis determined that not understanding the design basis of the circuit subject to relay coordination and the impact of the change in specific components as part of a 2008 design change was the cause of the condition. Corrective actions included the replacement of the X3 relay with the original design relay. Div. 2 RHR was returned to service on March 8. Subsequently, Div. 1 EDG was restored to OPERABLE on March 11. This is reportable as an unanalyzed condition, operation prohibited by the Technical Specifications, and a loss of safety function.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
"The High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) system was inoperable during a pre-planned maintenance activity when a significant oil leak in HPCI system oil piping occurred because of a cracked oil pipe nipple. The leak was of sufficient size that if it occurred outside the pre-planned maintenance HPCI would have been declared inoperable. The equipment failure analysis concluded that the most likely cause was that HPCI pipe nipple was exposed to significant loads sufficient to initiate a crack likely from applied wrench torques during oil leak repair activities in 2005. With the presence of the crack and crack propagation mechanism, the engineering evaluation determined that HPCI was inoperable from January 9 through March 24, 2016, i.e. 75 days. The organizational root cause was that management and individuals were tolerant of leaks on the HPCI system. As a result, station personnel did not effectively advocate prompt repair of the HPCI oil leak. The cracked HPCI oil pipe nipple was replaced. Results of the extent of condition review identified two other pipe nipples and two elbows with thread leakage (no crack present). The pipe nipples were replaced and the elbows were reused. The HPCI system was tested successfully after the repairs.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
"On 03/14/2012 at 1120 PDT SONGS Unit 3 was in Mode 5 (cold shutdown) when the first of eight Steam Generator (SG) tubes failed in-situ pressure testing. A SG tube is considered degraded and is reportable if it does not meet the tube integrity performance criteria stated in the SG Program (Technical Specification 5.5.2.11) as indicated by a failed in-situ test. In addition, the degraded condition was considered a safety system functional failure; i.e. potential failure to isolate radioactive fission products in the primary coolant from the secondary system as part of the reactor coolant pressure boundary. The first tube that failed was the tube with a through-wall leak that resulted in the Unit 3 shutdown from full power on 01/31/2012. Following the shutdown, extensive inspection, testing, and analysis of SG tube integrity in both Unit 3 SGs commenced, with a total of eight tubes failing in-situ testing in SG 3E088 as follows: on 03/14/12 three tubes did not meet the accident induced leakage performance criteria (exceeded 0.5 gpm at maximum pressure achieved during test); and on 03/15/12 and 03/16/12 a total of five tubes did not meet the structural integrity performance criteria (failed three-times normal pressure conditions). The postulated post-accident onsite and offsite doses were well below allowable limits. At the time of this event, Unit 2 was in a refueling outage. Planned inspection of 100 percent of the Unit 2 SG tubes was performed, with one tube requiring in-situ testing. This tube met the performance criteria.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']"
"On June 9, 2018, at 1240 hours, Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station (QCNPS) main turbine Main Stop Valve number 1 (MSV1) failed to provide the appropriate Reactor Protection System (RPS) relay actuations during periodic surveillance activities. The associated limit switch failed to properly actuate relays in subchannels of both the A and B RPS Trip System channels. Operations entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.1.1. Condition B due to one inoperable channel in each trip system. Fuses associated with the subchannels in both the A and B RPS channels were removed to meet the TS Action Statement.

"On March 14, 2021, at 1315 Central Daylight Time (CDT), Arkansas Nuclear One Unit 1 (ANO-1) was manually tripped due to an indicated degraded voltage and momentary loss of the non-vital 4160VAC bus A-2. Degraded voltage of the non-vital 4160VAC bus A-2 resulted in de-energizing the vital 4160VAC bus A-4. All systems responded as designed and the plant was stabilized in MODE 3 (Hot Standby). The cause of this event was a bent primary moveable contact in the 4160VAC Non-Vital bus A-2 Potential Transformer (PT) drawer. The damage to the primary moveable contact was corrected and repaired. The most likely cause was the ANO-1 Stator Drop accident in 2013 and subsequent repair of the 4160VAC Non-Vital bus A-2.

Troubleshooting identified the 2A Motor Control Center (MCC) breaker bucket containing the associated breaker was misaligned resulting in poor contact with the C phase of the electrical supply bus. It was identified that only the top retaining device  out of the two required retaining devices  used to secure the breaker bucket in the cubicle  was installed in the MCC. On August 3  2012  a spare retaining device was installed to replace the missing device. It could not be determined that the SGT Train C relative humidity heater would have functioned properly during a seismic event without the bottom retaining device.

"On December 11, 2020, at 1204 CT, while operating in MODE 1 at 100 percent power, Grand Gulf Nuclear Station experienced an Automatic Reactor Scram after a main turbine and generator trip. All Control Rods fully inserted and there were no complications associated with the Scram. All systems responded as designed and the plant was stabilized in MODE 3. The direct cause of the generator and turbine trip was while adding makeup water to the primary water system, the Operator misdiagnosed the response of the Leakage Water Return Valve and closed the valve manually. This led to a trip of the main turbine when the primary water system tank level lowered to the trip setpoint of 78 percent. Primary water is non-radioactive, ultra-purified water circulated to and from the generator to cool the generator stator, bushings, and rotor. The root causes for this event were: 1) Entergy Engineering Leadership established a design for the Leakage Water Return Valve control logic which was not fully understood and 2) the operating crew lacked adequate knowledge of the Primary Water System to control and stabilize the leakage water standpipe level. To preclude repetition, continuing training on the Primary Water system will be provided to GGNS License Operator and Non-License Operator. Entergy's procedure EN-HU-104, Technical Task Risk and Rigor, was revised, requiring a detailed table listing generation risk parameters being revised for engineering changes with high generation risk.

"On July 10, 2012, the alternate power supply for the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Unit 2 480V reactor motor operated valve (RMOV) board 2E was declared inoperable for performance of preventive maintenance (PM) activities. During these PM activities, the alternate feeder breaker was racked in and out of the cubicle. When the alternate feeder breaker was racked in after performance of PM activities, the manual trip pushbutton remained in the depressed position. On July 19, 2012, while preparing to perform PM activities, the 480V RMOV board 2E failed to manually transfer to its alternate power supply. Operations discovered the alternate feeder breaker manual trip pushbutton in the depressed position. The alternate feeder breaker would not close with this manual trip pushbutton in the depressed position. As a result, the 480V RMOV board 2E would not manually transfer and would also not have automatically transferred to its alternate power supply. The root cause was a process failure to provide positive verification that the critical aspects of the alternate feeder breaker were acceptable before the alternate feeder breaker was returned to service. The corrective action to prevent recurrence was to revise the operating instruction to provide verification that the manual trip pushbutton returned from the depressed position after racking in the alternate feeder breaker.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"At 1408 on September 18, 2015, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) was operating at 100 percent power when differential pressure of the Secondary Containment Reactor Building exceeded a Technical Specification requirement. The requirement is for the Secondary Containment to have a >/= 0.25 inch of vacuum water gauge compared to the external environment. During this event, Reactor Building differential pressure decreased below 0.25 inch of vacuum water gauge for approximately 3 minutes. This event was caused by the Refuel Floor Exhaust fan 'A' discharge damper 66AOD-106A going partially closed with concurrent failure of the associated fan discharge damper position indicating switch 66PNS-106A1. This resulted in obstructing exhaust flow from the Reactor Building. To correct the condition, the standby exhaust fan was placed in service. When Secondary Containment did not meet the Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement 3.6.4.1.1 for differential pressure, the Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) was not met. Therefore, Secondary Containment was Inoperable. Restoration of the LCO was completed within the allowed action completion time.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)']
On Sunday September 4 2022 at approximately 1638 hours with reactor power at 0% Nine Mile Point Unit 2 (NMP2) experienced a Reactor Protection System (RPS) Actuation on RPV Low Water Level (Level 3) of 159.3 inches. At the time of the RPS Actuation the reactor was already in a shutdown condition with all rods fully inserted. The Level 3 condition also initiated an isolation signal to Groups 4 and 5 Primary Containment Isolation valves which were already closed.

"On Saturday, February 23, 2019, Grand Gulf Nuclear Station (GGNS) experienced an unplanned automatic reactor shutdown without complications. This shutdown was initiated by the Reactor Protection System (RPS) as a result of a main generator lockout when the Generator Protective Relays responded to a negative phase sequence condition. All systems responded as designed. The negative phase sequence protection scheme set-point was changed (reduced from 9 percent to 5 percent) during the 2018 refueling outage as part of the new main generator protective relay modification. The new set-point was exceeded resulting in the main generator trip. The direct cause of the trip was the negative phase sequence protection scheme 5 percent set-point for the Generator Protective Relays was exceeded. The cause has been determined to be the failure to ensure systematic and rigorous control of the configuration change process. Corrective actions include returning the negative phase sequence relay set-point back to 9 percent and establishing an audible alarm to alert the control room staff of any of the Generator Protective Relays approaching a protective scheme set-point. Planned actions include the development and implementation of improved standards for overseeing and controlling engineering rigor during the design change process.

"On 4/12/2016 at 0312 CDT with Unit 1 (U1) at 100 percent power and Unit 2 (U2) in Mode 5, the U2 supply breaker for 1-2R 600V Load Center (LC) was racked out and the control power fuses removed for both U2 supply breaker and U1 supply breaker to support replacing an agastat relay on the U2 supply breaker. On 4/13/2016 at 0456 CDT the U1 supply breaker for the 1-2 R 600V LC tripped open when the control power fuses were restored and would not reclose. Technical Specifications (TS) 3.8.9 Condition A was entered for Unit 1 at 0456 on 4/13/2016 and exited at 0938 on 4/13/2016. Investigation attributed the cause to dirty contacts on the cell switch located in the U2 supply breaker cubicle. This condition would have prevented the U1 supply breaker from reclosing if a loss of offsite power had occurred between 04/12/2016 at 0312 and 4/13/2016 at 0938 leaving the 1-2R LC de-energized. This caused the LC to be inoperable for Unit 1 for more than the time allowed by TS 3.8.9. This is not reportable for Unit 2 due to the unit being in Mode 5 and having the necessary portion of the electrical power distribution subsystems operable. Corrective Action: The U2 supply breaker cell switch was cycled which cleaned the contacts and the U1 supply breaker closed. Post maintenance testing verified operability. Until replacement of the U2 supply breaker cell switch, administrative controls are in place to declare U1 supply breaker inoperable when racked out until the interlock feature is verified.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"The condition reported by this LER was an expected condition which was the result of planned activities in support of a routine refueling outage.

"On October 7 2022 during a Liquid Penetrant examination on the embedded flaw seal weld repair of Control Rod Drive Mechanism Penetration 69 five 1/4-inch rounded indications were discovered that were determined to be unacceptable per the acceptance criteria in ASME Section III. The cause of these indications is attributed to existing mechanical discontinuities/minor subsurface voids growing or opening to the weld surface due to thermal and/or pressure stresses during plant operation. The indications were reduced to an acceptable dimension by grinding/blending the indications to meet the applicable acceptance criteria in ASME Section III. This event is reportable in accordance with ""any event or condition that results in the condition of the nuclear power plant including its principal safety barriers being seriously degraded"" since the as-found indications did not meet the applicable acceptance criterion referenced in ASME Section III to remain in service without repair.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A)']
"On October 8, 2012, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) identified fire areas that did not conform to Appendix R requirements and did not have proceduralized or practiced compensatory measures in place. PG&E identified these concerns in the course of responding to requests for information and questions from NRC inspectors conducting a Diablo Canyon Power Plant Triennial Fire Protection Inspection. On October 9, 2012, at 21:32 PDT, PG&E reported these concerns to the NRC in Event Notification Number 48395. PG&E established compensatory actions in accordance with the DCPP Fire Protection Program requirements and plant procedures on the discovery of each condition. PG&E reviewed the NFPA 805 project open items to ensure they complied with Appendix R or were addressed in the corrective action program with compensatory measures established as necessary. Additionally, PG&E reviewed all alternate compensatory measures (ACMs) implemented by the fire protection program to ensure that all credited ACMs were adequate to ensure safe shutdown (SSD).

"On March 2, 2015, it was identified that Columbia Generating Station's (Columbia) barrier impairment procedure which allowed for floor plugs in the room above the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) System pump rooms to be removed was non-conservative and Columbia had been non-compliant with Technical Specifications. Specifically, from December 3, 2014, until December 19, 2014, floor plugs over Residual Heat Removal (RHR) System B pump were removed without an adequate flood barrier resulting in RHR System B being inoperable. The barrier impairment procedure allowed for removal of ECCS or RCIC floor plugs with either a one hour flood tour or installation of a berm as a compensatory measure to maintain operability of the applicable ECCS or RCIC System. A one hour flood tour was initiated per the procedure, and a berm was erected; however, both the one hour flood tour and the berm were inadequate. Corrective actions planned to prevent recurrence includes revising the barrier impairment process.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
"On December 17, 2023, while in Mode 6 with refueling operations in progress, Waterford Steam Electric Station Unit 3 identified that Technical Specification (TS) 3.9.2, Refueling Operations Instrumentation, Action (a) to suspend core alterations was not entered during Startup Channel 1 functional testing. The functional test renders the Startup Channel being tested inoperable. This resulted in non-compliance with the Technical Specification for Refueling Operations Instrumentation, 3.9.2, which requires that at a minimum, two source range neutron flux monitors shall be OPERABLE and operating, each with continuous visual indication in the control room and one with audible indication in the containment and control room in MODE 6.

"A review of plant conditions from June 2013 revealed two instances of an operation or condition that was prohibited by Technical Specifications. The reportable conditions were the result of improper operability assessment when the B Filtration Recirculation and Ventilation System (FRVS) recirculation unit failed to start on a manual start demand on 6/24/13. As a result, two instances of Tech Spec non-compliance were identified. The first occurred on 6/10/13 and the second on 6/17/13. This was discovered during a review conducted in February 2015. In addition, routine Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) activities created a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function due to the failure to recognize the B FRVS recirculation unit inoperability.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
During the performance of the quarterly flow verification the 1A Standby Liquid Control (SBLC) Pump could not obtain the Technical Specification required flow of 40 gallons per minute due to the SBLC Injection Pump 'A' Discharge Pressure Relief Valve (PSV148F029A) lifting and being unable to reseat itself. This failed to meet the requirements of Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement 3.1.7.7 and consequently the 1A SBLC pump was declared inoperable. The 'B' train of Standby Liquid Control had been unavailable during the time the 'A' was inoperable. The cause of the event was determined to be inadequate work instructions for installing the insulation on the associated relief valves. Corrective actions include additional guidance for installing insulation around the relief valves. There were no actual safety consequences associated with this event.,"['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A)']"
"On January 18 2014 while operating at 75 percent power in Mode 1 Harris Nuclear Plant manually actuated the reactor protection system to trip Unit 1 due to indications of a fire in the 480V 1D2 transformer. After the reactor trip the auxiliary feedwater system automatically initiated and provided feedwater to the steam generators. De-energizing auxiliary bus 1D caused a temporary loss of power to the 6.9kV 1A-SA safety bus and thus the ""A"" auxiliary feedwater pump which was recovered when the ""A"" emergency diesel generator started and re-energized the 1A-SA bus. All safety systems responded as expected during this event. The root cause was determined to be a combination of age and various electro-magnetic conditions which over time led to failure of the 1D2 transformer. Corrective actions include transformer replacements and additional testing. The impact on safety due to this event is a small risk increase of approximately 3E-6/yr in delta core damage frequency.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On May 27  2018 at 0630 EDT  the Reactor Water Cleanup (RWCU) System Isolation Differential Flow - High function was declared inoperable as a result of the RWCU Differential Flow Indicator reading downscale. This condition would have prevented the primary containment isolation valves for the RWCU system from automatically isolating on a high differential flow signal. The cause of the downscale reading was due to a capacitor failure within the square root converter. Corrective actions were taken to replace the capacitors within the square root converter and return the RWCU System Isolation Differential Flow - High function to operable on May 28  2018 at 0046 EDT. The safety related function of the RWCU System is to provide primary containment isolation upon receipt of a primary containment isolation signal  or upon indication of a high-energy line break (HELB) in the RWCU System piping in response to the following signals: low reactor water level 2; high RWCU equipment temperatures; high RWCU pump room differential temperature; or high RWCU System differential flow. Due to the availability of other automatic RWCU isolation functions as well as the ability to manually isolate RWCU  the safety significance of this event is very low. There were no radiological releases associated with this event.,"['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']"
On June 30 2016 at 1715 CDT Grand Gulf Nuclear Station (GGNS) experienced an electrical power supply loss from Service Transformer 21 which resulted in power supply being lost to Division 2 (16AB Bus) and Division 3 (17AC Bus) ESF buses. This resulted in a valid actuation of Division 2 and Division 3 Diesel Generators on bus under voltage. They both automatically started and energized their respective ESF buses as designed. During this event the loss of power to the Division 2 (16AB Bus) resulted in a Division 2 RPS bus power loss which actuated a Division 2 RPS half SCRAM signal. The power loss also resulted in a loss of the Instrument Air pressure resulting in some Control Rod Scram Valves to drift open. This in turn caused the Scram Discharge Volume to fill to the point where a Division 1 RPS half SCRAM signal was initiated from Scram Discharge Volume level high on Channel 'A'. This resulted in a valid full RPS Reactor SCRAM while not critical. Instrument Air pressure was restored and the SCRAM signal was reset at 1733 CDT. Appropriate off normal event procedures were entered to mitigate the transient. All safety systems performed as expected. The Direct Cause was a failure of the taped insulation on the 'C' phase 34.5 kV Service Transformer power supply cable to the BOP 23 Transformer. The Apparent Cause was an outer tape wrap insulation failure that left a moisture path between the braid connecting the splice and the center conductor. A temporary three phase overhead line was installed to bypass the faulted 34.5 kV cable section. A planned corrective action to install a permanent underground replacement Iwas generated.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"From May 4 through 5, 2015, during a planned Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) pressure test following RPV reassembly from refuel outage H1R19, Hope Creek Generating Station (HCGS) did not comply with Technical Specification Action Statement 3.5.2, action a. The plant lineup to support the RPV pressure test is classified as an Operation With the Potential to Drain the Vessel (OPDRV). Technical Specification (TS) 3.5.2, ECCS Shutdown, requires that at least two Low Pressure ECCS subsystems be OPERABLE in Operational Condition 4. The TS requires that with only one ECCS subsystem operable, two subsystems shall be restored to operable status within four hours or suspend all OPDRVs. Contrary to this requirement, HCGS conducted the RPV pressure test OPDRV activity with only one low pressure ECCS subsystem operable. This condition existed from May 4 at 0400 until May 5 at 1042, a period of 30 hours and 42 minutes. TS compliance was restored on May 5 at 1042 when a second low pressure ECCS system was returned to OPERABLE. The cause of the event was determined to be failure to properly assess the operability status of all the ECCS subsystems which could be used to meet TS 3.5.2. This conditions is being reported as a condition prohibited by TS.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On October 20, 2023, following the performance of Integrated Test Sequencing (ITS), Unit 1 Train A Neutron Flux Monitoring System (Gamma Metrics) failed to automatically restart. ITS is performed to verify the proper response of Safeguards equipment following a Safety Injection (SI) in conjunction with a Loss of Offsite Power (LOOP). Operators questioned the reliability of the Gamma Metrics system during accident conditions and a follow-up evaluation of Gamma Metrics performance on April 3, 2024, found that both trains of the Unit 1 Gamma Metrics would be unable to automatically restart during a LOOP and had been inoperable in the past for longer than allowed by Technical Specifications (TS). The direct cause of the Gamma Metrics failure was an overload trip of the high voltage power supply (HVPS). Vendor analysis of the component is ongoing and the specific failure mode has not been determined. Results of the failure analysis will be provided in a supplemental report. Corrective actions include a temporary modification to improve power restoration to the system and a procedure revision for compensatory operator actions.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
On 3/1/2012  at 1353 hours  an issue was identified with the doors for the safety related battery rooms and their normal position. Several doors to the battery rooms are held open via electromagnetic door devices. At the time  it was thought that there was no uninterruptible power to the door mechanisms  and that all the doors are expected to close in the event of a loss of offsite power (LOOP). Inadvertent closure of the doors following a momentary loss of power prevents their design function of venting hydrogen from the battery rooms and providing tornado venting pathways in the building. Compensatory measures were taken to secure the doors open to maintain the hydrogen purging and tornado venting functions. A roving fire watch was implemented to comply with the fire protection function of the doors. As an extent of condition on 3/12/12  the cable spread room (CSR) doors were also identified to utilize the same design and electrical supply configuration as the battery room doors. The CSR is located above the battery rooms in the Electric and Control (E&C) Building. Contingency actions were put in place to secure the CSR doors open and implement a fire impairment in the event of a tornado risk. On 4/11/12  it was discovered that the battery room and CSR doors have small battery backup units which could sustain the doors with adequate power to maintain their position for 45 seconds sufficient to allow AC power to be restored through the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) during a tornado. However  the backup units were found to be in a state of degradation  challenging the ability of the backup batteries to maintain their power supply to the door hold-open devices during a tornado event. No recent preventive maintenance work orders exist for the inspection or replacement of these units. There were no actual safety consequences impacting the plant or public safety as a result of these events. The cause was a design process legacy issue  and current design processes are significantly different from those in place during early operation of CPNPP. The specific conditions have been addressed in the corrective action program and  along with current programs and practices  are adequate to prevent future occurrences. All times in this report are approximate and Central Time unless noted otherwise.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B)']
"On 02/09/2015 at approximately 0504 EDT with Unit 2 in Mode 3 at zero percent power due to a scheduled refueling outage the Unit 2 ""A"" and ""C"" outboard main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) failed to close in the required fast stroke time requirements of 3 to 5 seconds. The ""2A"" outboard isolation valve closed in 6.8 seconds and the ""2C"" outboard isolation valve closed in 10.3 seconds. The surveillance tests were declared unsatisfactory and the affected Unit 2 ""A"" and ""C"" main steam lines were maintained in an isolated configuration as all the MSIVs remained closed. The cause of the unsatisfactory surveillance testing on the ""2A"" and ""2C"" outboard MSIVs was determined to be excess lubrication on the pistons and springs of the 2-way and 4-way valves of the pneumatic manifold assembly of the MSIV actuator. The excess super o-lube applied to the valve internals had become tacky causing a delay in the opening of the air supply and exhaust paths for the air operator cylinder of the MSIV actuator. As part of a broadness review additional MSIV actuators on Unit 2 were determined to be susceptible to excess lubrication. All of the associated 2-way 3-way and 4-way valves of the pneumatic manifold assemblies were replaced or inspected, cleaned, and re-lubricated. The MSIVs were then reassembled and functionality tested to ensure the isolation valves were capable of meeting their stroke time of 3 to 5 seconds. The associated surveillance tests were satisfactorily completed and the MSIVs were returned to service in concurrence with the startup of Unit 2.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
On August 20  2017 at 1605 PDT  Columbia Generating Station was manually scrammed due to a rise in Main Condenser back pressure. The rise in back pressure was due to the spurious closure of the Main Condenser Air Removal Suction Valve (AR-V-1) as a result of the failure of it's associated solenoid pilot valve. Following the reactor scram and depressurization of the reactor a Level 3 actuation occurred. In addition a startup flow control valve failed which necessitated throttling of the Feedwater start-up level control isolation valve to control Reactor Pressure Vessel level. All other safety systems functioned as expected and all control rods were fully inserted. Reactor decay heat was removed via bypass valves to the main condenser. The apparent cause was the plant modification to address the single point vulnerability of the closure of AR-V-1 was not implemented in time to prevent a plant shutdown. A temporary modification has been installed to maintain AR-V-1 open for the remainder of the operating cycle. These events are reportable in accordance with regulations.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On April 15  2021  Donald C. Cook Unit 2 was in Mode 1 and holding at approximately 49% reactor power while performing Technical Specification (TS) surveillance testing on the Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSVs) prior to the Unit 2 Cycle 26 (U2C26) Refueling Outage. The Unit 2 Steam Generator (SG) #3 MSSV 2-SV-1A-3 and 2-SV-2B-3 as-found lift setpoint test pressures were above the TS allowable setpoint pressure band of +/- 3 percent. SG #2 MSSV 2-SV-2B-2 as-found lift setpoint was below the allowable setpoint pressure. Setpoint drift was determined as the similar cause for the affected MSSVs. Following adjustments  the MSSVs met the as-left testing criteria of +/- 1 percent lift setpoint pressure. The identified discrepancies would normally be considered to occur at the time of test. However  based on the guidance in NUREG-1022  Revision 3  for ""Multiple Test Failures""  the condition may have arisen over a period of time during the operating cycle. In accordance with NUREG-1022 guidance  MSSVs are considered to have been inoperable during plant operation, for a period longer than allowed by TS.

"On September 13, 2017, with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station operating at approximately 100 percent power, Auxiliary Feed Water (AFW) Pump Turbine 1 experienced high inboard bearing temperature during performance of quarterly Surveillance Testing. The turbine was tripped, and disassembly revealed damage to the journal bearing. The bearing was replaced, and following successful post maintenance testing, AFW Train 1 was declared Operable on September 16. The cause of the bearing damage was an improperly marked oil sight glass, which allowed operation with improper bearing lubrication. The improper markings were due to the maintenance work instruction for replacing the sight glass not including dimensions or guidance for setting required operational bands. On September 26, 2017, it was identified that low inboard bearing oil level had likely existed since completion of the previous quarterly surveillance test on June 21, when an oil sample was taken following testing but the bearing was not refilled due to the improperly marked sight glass. This issue is being reported as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function, and as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B)']"
"On December 14, 2015, an automatic reactor trip (RT) occurred due to a Turbine-Generator trip caused by a fault on 345 kV feeder W96 transmission tower IP3-4. All control rods fully inserted and all required safety systems functioned properly. The plant was stabilized in hot standby with decay heat being removed by the condenser. The auxiliary feedwater system actuated as expected due to steam generator low level from shrink effect. Inspections identified that an electrical fault damaged the 345 kV Transmission Tower line insulators. Direct cause of the RT was radial flashover of insulators on C phase of the 345 kV feeder W96 line at Transmission Tower IP3-4. The most likely cause is a pre-existing damaged insulator as a result of a prior flashover event that resulted in a repeat flashover due to environmental conditions. A single event with multiple flashovers associated with reduced insulation resistance due to a bird streamer is possible but less likely. Transmission Tower design does not have barriers to prevent avian perching on feeder towers. Corrective actions included inspection of Transmission Tower line insulators and ancillary hardware and replacement of damaged insulators and hardware. The preventive maintenance (PM) scope for the Unit 2 345 kV and 138 kV feeders was revised to include inspection and cleaning of Transmission Tower line insulators and hardware. An action request was generated to implement PM Template ENN-EP-G-004, Attachment 7.7, and Model Work Orders were revised and thermography and corona camera inspections performed. Bird guards will be installed on Entergy owned 345 kV and 138 kV Transmission Towers to preclude the effects of bird streaming.

On May 21  2012  at 2:52 p.m.  while the plant was operating at 100% power  an automatic reactor scram occurred due to a partial loss of vacuum in the main condenser. This condition initially caused a trip of the main turbine  and the fast closure of the turbine control valves provided the actuation signal to the reactor protection system (RPS). Main condenser vacuum remained within the operating limits for use of the main turbine bypass valves  thus reactor pressure was automatically controlled following the initial transient. The reactor feedwater system remained in service. The decrease in main condenser vacuum resulted from the loss of two of four circulating water pumps. This condition was caused by the failure of a splice in one of three 13.8kV cables providing power to half of the 4160V switchgear at the circulating water structure. The splice failure resulted in a small fire inside a manhole located outside the protected area. The plant fire brigade confirmed the fire was out within approximately 24 minutes of the onset of the event. Six reactor safety-relief valves actuated in response to the main turbine trip. The reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) system steam supply valve automatically closed due to a false high-flow signal from the steam flow sensors. The system was restored to its standby configuration at 5:36 p.m. No plant parameters requiring the automatic actuation of the RCIC system were exceeded during the event. The failed splice was replaced  and the other cables in the circuit were tested for integrity  resulting in the replacement of one other splice. There were no safety-related systems out of service at the time of the event.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
On January 9  2016  at approximately 2:37 a.m. CST  with the plant operating at 100 percent power  an automatic reactor scram occurred concurrent with the closure of all main steam isolation valves (MSIVs). That action was the result of an electrical transient caused by a phase-to-phase fault on a nearby 230kV transmission line. The transient caused a momentary decrease in the voltage on both reactor protection system busses  which also power the MSIV control solenoids. The Division 2 primary containment isolation logic was also actuated  causing the Division 2 valves in balance-of-plant systems to close. Both divisions of the standby gas treatment system automatically started due to the shutdown of the normal annulus pressure control system. Both reactor recirculation pumps downshifted to slow speed. The company's transmission department investigated the event. Although no definite source of the fault was found  it was concluded that a lightning strike likely caused the transient. The fault occurred on a 230kV transmission line approximately three miles from the station. The fault lasted for 5.4 cycles before it was isolated by automatic breaker action  and caused the voltage on the switchgear supplying the RPS busses to decrease to approximately 34 percent of normal. This transient was sufficient to trip the scram solenoids and the MSIV solenoids. No plant parameter limits requiring the automatic actuation of any of the emergency core cooling systems or the emergency diesel generators were exceeded. This event  thus  was of minimal significance to the health and safety of the public.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On November 27, 2016, the Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant (MNGP) was operating at 100% power. While troubleshooting was in progress for a minor leak on the High Pressure Coolant Injection System (HPCI) turbine, it was discovered that the HPCI turbine exhaust drain pot level switch was not functioning per design to support removal of condensate from the HPCI turbine. Subsequently, HPCI was declared inoperable at 1447 hours due to excessive water level within the HPCI turbine. Previously, on November 17, 2016, a steam leak was identified on the packing of the HPCI turbine steam supply valve. Following valve packing maintenance on November 21, 2016, the valve was cycled cold (without steam flow), resulting in seat leakage that slowly admitted steam into the HPCI exhaust piping. The steam condensed to water and accumulation began to form in the HPCI turbine. Subsequent troubleshooting found the HPCI exhaust drain pot level switch electrical rocker assembly off its pivot point due to a manufacturer defect (missing spot weld). With the inability to pivot, the level switch became non-functional and thus failed to alert the control room and provide the automatic function to drain condensate from the HPCI exhaust piping. The HPCI exhaust piping was drained of condensate and a temporary modification replaced level switch. HPCI was restored to operable status at 1726 hours on December 1, 2016.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']
On June 23  2013  at 22:01 PDT  Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) Diablo Canyon Power Plant (DCPP) Unit 1 control room operators used an annunciator response procedure to address the loss of startup power.

On June 24  2013  at 22:07 PDT  PG&E made an 8-hour  non-emergency report to the NRC (reference NRC Event Notification Number 49147). DCPP determined that this was the result of inattention by control room operators  lack of oversight by the Shift Foreman  and an absence of cautionary instructions in the annunciator response procedure. Plant management issued an Operations Shift Order that reinforces guidance and expectations for oversight  processed personnel accountability as appropriate  and will revise plant procedures for oversight and annunciator response.

Nine Mile Point Unit 2 (NMP2) secondary containment was declared inoperable on June 10  2014 from 2032 until 2036. The event occurred while the plant was restoring the Reactor Building Ventilation System to normal line up. Exhaust Fan 2HVR-FN5A tripped following planned post maintenance testing which resulted in building differential pressure (dP) exceeding the Technical Specification (TS) limit of ≥ 0.25 inch vacuum water gauge. Secondary containment dP was restored within TS limits by starting the Standby Exhaust Fan. Both the TS Action Statement and plant procedure were exited at 2036 when secondary containment was declared operable. The cause of the exhaust fan trip was a faulty flow switch. Corrective actions taken or planned to prevent a recurrence include: 1) replaced Flow Switch 2HVR- FS12A  2) revising the Preventative Maintenance (PM) strategy for Reactor Building ventilation supply and exhaust fan flow switches  and 3) revising a plant procedure to clarify fan start requirements.

At 0030 EST on February 21  2015  while operating at 100 percent Reactor Thermal Power (RTP)  the West Turbine Bypass Valve (TBV) automatically opened as expected for approximately 1 minute in response to the number two High Pressure Turbine Stop Valve (TSV) cycling from full open to closed and then to 22 percent open due to an actuator malfunction. Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.1.1 requires that the TSV closure and Turbine Control Valve (TCV) fast closure RPS functions be operable at or above 29.5 percent RTP. Per TS Bases 3.3.1.1  TBVs must remain shut while RTP is at or above 29.5 percent to consider all channels of the TSV closure and TCV fast closure Reactor Protection System (RPS) functions operable. As a result  all channels of the TSV closure and TCV fast closure RPS functions were considered inoperable and TS 3.3.1.1 Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) Condition 'C' was entered. At 0031 EST the TBV automatically closed and the TSV closure and TCV fast closure RPS functions were no longer considered inoperable and the TS LCO was exited. Reactor Operators lowered RTP to 91.5 percent to isolate and restore the TSV to full open. In this event  during the period of time while the TBV was open  reactor power was maintained above 91.5 percent and the RPS functions were confirmed to be enabled. The actuator malfunction was caused by a failed comparator circuit card in the TSV valve control module. The failed comparator circuit card was replaced.,"['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)']"

On August 31 2018 while operating at approximately 29 percent power a reactor manual scram signal was inserted on Unit 2 due to main condenser vacuum degrading. The turbine was tripped following the scram. During the scram one control rod did not fully insert but was manually fully inserted. The plant was in a stable condition with reactor pressure being maintained by the turbine bypass valves and reactor water level was controlled using feedwater. Except for the single control rod insertion required safety systems and shutdown equipment performed as expected and there was no impact to Unit 1. This condition was reported on August 31 2018 (ENS 53576) in accordance with a reactor protection system (RPS) actuation. This condition is reportable as a condition that resulted in a valid actuation of the RPS. The condition was attributed to localized impingement degradation of a turbine building miscellaneous equipment drain header resulting in through-wall failure. Corrective actions were taken to install a robust welded temporary patch on the drain header with a header replacement scheduled for the upcoming Unit 2 refueling outage L2R17 (2019) and revise procedures to incorporate lessons learned.

At 10:18 EDT on October 26  2012  at 100% power in Mode 1  the Primary Shield Supply Fan S-2B-SB failed to remain secured after engaging the Main Control Board (MCB) hand switch during monthly equipment swaps. At 15:26 EDT on October 31  2012  the breaker for the fan was opened due to the fan not remaining secured when stopped. Failure of the fan to secure was determined to be a failure of the 42 seal-in contact for breaker 1B21-SB-4B which supplies the S-2B-SB fan. The condition was present for approximately 5 days from the time of discovery during the monthly equipment swaps until the breaker was opened and tagged. This condition is reportable as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. This condition was determined to be reportable on December 6  2012. Root and contributing causes will be determined in the Root Cause Evaluation which is ongoing. This LER will be supplemented when the evaluation is complete. The 42 seal-in contact was replaced and the S-2B-SB fan was successfully started and secured from the MCB hand switch for post maintenance testing. Applicable plant procedures have been revised to address the condition when breakers for selected loads started from the sequencer fail to open and the corresponding impact on operability.,['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"The station identified that the CCW pumps were operating beyond their pump curves with the motor running into the service factor. Runout conditions were not observed as there were no fluctuations in pressure, no fluctuations in motor amps, no visible signs of pitting or damage on impeller vein trailing, no damage to internal pump casing surfaces, no abnormal vibration, and no abnormal noise. A review of this condition determined that operation in this condition is a violation of plant technical specification for CCW operation. A cause analysis is in progress. The results of the analysis will be published in a supplement to this LER.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On January 24, 2023 at 0121 CST, the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, Unit 1, High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) was declared inoperable because the normally-open HPCI Steam Line Condensate Outboard Drain Valve failed closed, apparently due to a failed diaphragm. On January 24, 2023, at 0743 CST, eight-hour Event Notification 56321 was made to the NRC. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) is submitting this report as any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. The diaphragm prematurely failed due to a part manufacturing issue, which led to the local delamination between the fabric and the ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) material, in conjunction with a lack of complete reinforcement fabric coverage at the tear site. The failed diaphragm was replaced. TVA will proactively replace the diaphragms on Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Units 2 and 3. HPCI Steam Line Condensate Outboard Drain Valve diaphragms will be reclassified.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']
"On June 12, 2018, while in Mode 3 and investigating leakage at Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1, a leak was identified on a drain line associated with one of the four High Pressure Injection lines which discharge to the Reactor Coolant System (RCS). The subject leak was identified during a walk down of Reactor Building structures, systems, and components initiated in response to an elevated RCS leak rate. The leak was a result of a cyclic fatigue failure originating from poor weld geometry and grinding marks present on the axial weld toe of the associated field weld. The leak was subsequently repaired and the unit returned to power operation. The corrective action plan addressed the causal factors associated with this event. Corrective actions completed or planned include 1) similar locations were inspected for weld defects, 2) enhanced training of the specific weld type, and 3) planned mockups for future high risk / high value welds. This event had no effect on the public health and safety. The event was reported to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on June 12, 2018, via Event Notification 53456.","['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A)', '10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A)']"

"On February 8 2016 at approximately 0147 hours during a surveillance test, control room indications identified that 3B Emergency Containment Cooler (ECC) fan tripped. Troubleshooting found the control power fuse for the fan's power supply breaker was loose in its fuse holder. Investigation revealed that the fuse holder clips had been widened during work activities associated with the installation of the new breaker during the prior Unit 3 refueling and maintenance outage. The most probable cause of the loose fuse was improper insertion. In addition, the installation procedure did not validate fuse holder gap, fuse alignment, and fuse tightness after its last removal and insertion prior to placing the new breaker in service. Inadequate contact during the surveillance test caused the fan trip. The 3B ECC would not have reliably met its safety function mission time and so was determined to be inoperable for approximately 72 days exceeding the 72 hour Technical Specification allowed outage time. Corrective actions include: 1) The fuse holder clips were adjusted to provide a tight fit. 2) A review determined additional similar breakers will be inspected for fuse tightness. 3) Future installation and preventive maintenance of similar breakers will check for fuse tightness and correct if necessary. Safety significance is considered low based on a risk assessment showing Incremental Conditional Core Damage Probability and Incremental Conditional Large Early Release Probability are below the NRC acceptance criteria for minimal risk impact.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On September 18 2018 with the reactor at 100 percent power at approximately 0525 hours Operators manually tripped the reactor and shut the Main Steam Isolation Valves due to a steam leak on the 6 inch elbow located upstream of the 36C Feedwater Heater. The steam leak was due to a failure of the 6 inch elbow. The cause of the failure was flow accelerated corrosion which lead to pipe wall thinning and subsequent pipe failure. Ultrasonic testing of the elbow showed flow accelerated corrosion thinning in the failed elbow and also in the adjacent upstream elbow. Following the reactor trip, the plant was stabilized in hot standby with decay heat being removed from the steam generators via the Auxiliary Feedwater System and atmospheric steam dumps. This event had no effect on the public health and safety.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On February 10, 2014, Monticello personnel identified that the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) would not energize permanently connected loads until 10.2 or 10.34 seconds for Division I and Division II, respectively, which exceeded the 10-second limitation of Monticello Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.8.1.12. As a result, both EDGs were declared inoperable. The apparent cause of this event is that the description of the EDG TS SR was inadvertently changed during the transition from custom TS 4.9.B.3 to improved TS SR 3.8.1.12 due to improper verification and validation practices of the Improved TS preparation team in 2004-2006. The set-points for the applicable relays have been revised. The time delay set-point change provides a setting to support EDG performance meeting the 10-second acceptance criterion of SR 3.8.1.12.

The 2RE9160A valve was immediately declared inoperable based on the unqualified valve diaphragm. The associated containment penetration was isolated per the required actions in Byron Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.3, Condition A. Since the condition existed for longer than allowed by TS 3.6.3 (Containment Isolation Valves), Required Action A.1, i.e., for more than 4 hours, this is a reportable condition.

The cause of the unsealed penetration is unknown and is considered a legacy issue as this conduit was routed prior to 1991. The EFT fire protection barrier will be restored to functional status and the penetration will be periodically inspected. The Fire Barrier Wall, Damper, and Floor Inspection procedure will be revised to add use of additional tools (e.g., cameras or boroscope) to perform inspections on portions of fire barriers that are not easily accessed.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B)']
"On May 19th 2021 during the periodic scheduled performance of Plant Protection System (PPS) functional testing an invalid actuation of the Safety Injection Actuation Signal, Containment Isolation Actuation Signal, and Main Steam Isolation Signal (MSIS) of both trains occurred. This led to a reactor trip and the start of the Diesel Generators and Essential Spray Pond pumps. In addition, Low Steam Generator level signals actuated the Auxiliary Feedwater Actuation Signals which started both essential Auxiliary Feedwater pumps. The Unit 2 reactor tripped because of High Pressurizer Pressure that occurred as a result of a transient initiated by the MSIS actuation and rapid closure of the Main Steam Isolation Valves. This event was initiated by a failure of the Engineered Safety Features Actuation System (ESFAS) test circuit which caused a loss of hold power circuit continuity for critical ESFAS trip paths through the PPS Relay Hold Switch which allowed the trip signals to initiate the applicable plant response. The PPS components involved with the trip were replaced on May 21, 2021, and plant operation was restored. At the time of the trip, PVNGS Unit 1 was operating at 100 percent power and Unit 3 was in a refueling outage. Neither unit was impacted by the event.

"At 2002 Eastern Standard Time (EST) on January 17, 2018, Watts Bar Nuclear Plant Unit 1 annulus differential pressure went outside its pressure limit. At that time, the Shield Building was declared inoperable requiring entry into Technical Specification 3.6.15 Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) Conditions A and B. Action was taken by field operators to swap annulus vacuum control dampers due to slow system response to restore annulus differential pressure. At 2024 EST, annulus differential pressure was restored to required limits, the Shield Building was declared operable, and TS 3.6.15 LCO Conditions A and B were exited. This is being reported as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. The cause of this transient is a combination of slow damper response and procedural issues. Immediate corrective actions to address this included the completion of damper field tuning. Procedure changes for operation of the annulus vacuum system will be completed and preventative maintenance instructions will be revised to require field tuning on annulus vacuum control dampers.

"On November 26 2012, Operator review of a tag-out for a Preventive Maintenance of the Steam Generator (SG) blowdown (SGBD) radiation monitor R-49 determined the tagout would have placed all the SGBD isolation valves (ISVs) in Rad Bypass. Operators could not identify any procedure allowing this action and determined this action was previously reported in LER-2012-004 as an unanalyzed condition and safety system functional failure when an Auxiliary Feedwater pump is out of service. The normal ISV position is open which allows the ISVs to Auto close for heat sink events (Loss of Normal Feedwater Loss of All AC Power to the Station Auxiliaries) in addition to containment Phase A isolation. Analyzed degraded heat sink events assume SGBD isolation occurs and continuous SGBD during these events has not been analyzed. SG inventory would not be maintained if only one motor-driven AFW pump was operable as it may not provide adequate flow with the SGBD ISVs open. A review identified previous tagouts that placed the SGBD ISVs in Rad Bypass with an Auxiliary Feedwater pump or its emergency power supply inoperable. The apparent cause has not been determined. Corrective action was revision of procedure 2-PC-2Y23-49 to delete steps to place in Rad Bypass while performing Radiation Monitor R-49 calibration and installation of a test jumper to disable the blowdown function (as reported in LER- 2012-004). Applicable archived tagouts were locked from further use. UFSAR Section 14.1.9 was revised to state SGBD isolation is assumed starting from event initiation.

"On March 10, 2017, during a Technical Specification surveillance, the as-found operating time of one of four undervoltage timing relays in a Safety related 4.16kV switchgear was greater than the Technical Specification allowable value. The relay was retested without making any changes to the relay timing or the test configuration. The second test resulted in a lower value that was within the Technical Specification allowable value but outside the acceptance criteria of the procedure. A third test (and subsequent follow-up testing) resulted in values that met Technical Specification limits. The associated channel was declared Operable. On March 14, 2017, an engineer reviewed the surveillance results and questioned the reliability of the relay based on its behavior. The Control Room was contacted and the relay was replaced. Based on the engineer's analysis, the Shift Manager determined that the relay should not have been declared Operable on March 10. The Technical Specification Action Statement required the inoperable channel to be placed in the tripped condition within 72 hours. This Action was not met and is reportable as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications.

"At approximately 2333 on July 26, 2013, electrical faults caused damage to the isophase bus to the unit auxiliary transformer and main generator neutral connection box. Protective relaying initiated a generator trip to isolate the faulted area and to trip the main turbine. A reactor trip from 100% power resulted from the turbine trip. A small cable insulation and oil collection pan fire initiated from the main generator neutral connection box fault and created smoke throughout the Turbine Building. An Unusual Event was declared as a result of the fire and resulting smoke. The fire was extinguished within 30 minutes and smoke was removed from the building using installed equipment. The electrical faults were the result of a damper blade that was loose within the isophase bus ductwork, creating arcing between the bus, damper blade, and duct. The loose damper blade is attributed to damper failure based on the determination that the operational isophase bus duct airflow rate exceeded the design flow rate for the backdraft dampers. Design and installation errors were made at the main generator neutral connection box during plant construction. Redesigned backdraft dampers were installed, and grating was added to prevent debris from entering the isophase bus ducts. Modifications were also made to the generator neutral connection box.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A)']
"On November 29, 2021, at 1458 Central Standard Time (CST), while operating in Mode 1 at 100% power, Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1 (ANO-1) automatically tripped due to high Reactor Coolant System pressure following a Main Feedwater System transient. All control rods fully inserted and all systems responded as designed. The plant was stabilized in Mode 3 (Hot Standby). The cause of the Main Feedwater System transient was the failure of the 'A' MFP High Pressure (HP) governor to respond to lowering 'A' MFP speed. The initiating event was a failure of the 'A' MFP LP governor servo drive and actuator. When the LP governor servo drive failed, the HP governor did not respond to restore 'A' MFP speed. Proper program values had not been input in the HP governor controller during previous maintenance in 2015.

Farley Nuclear Plant (FNP) Unit 1 in Mode 1 at 100 percent power the reactor automatically tripped following a generator trip and subsequent turbine trip signal. A floor tile was dropped in the high voltage switch house resulting in a relay actuation that electrically isolated Bus 1 in the 230kV switchyard. The ""B"" train emergency safeguards (ES) bus lost power along with 1B, 1C, and 1E non safety related 4160V busses. The 1A 4160V non safety bus did not fast bus transfer to its alternate power supply, which along with isolation of the 230kV Bus 1, resulted in all Reactor Coolant Pumps being deenergized. Residual heat was removed by natural circulation via the atmospheric relief valves. The 1B emergency diesel automatically actuated due to the loss of power to the ""B"" train ES bus. In addition, the Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) automatically started as expected in response to the reactor trip.
