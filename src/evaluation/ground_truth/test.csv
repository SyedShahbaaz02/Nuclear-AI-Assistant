"On August 18, 2014, approximately 14 hours into a 24-hour surveillance test of Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) 1B, Operators noted cylinder 5L exhaust temperature decreased by 130 degrees Fahrenheit and power indication began oscillating. Operations began an orderly shutdown of EDG 1B. Subsequently, Operators in the diesel room reported an unusual noise, at which time Operations immediately unloaded and stopped EDG 1B. EDG 1B was subsequently repaired and tested satisfactorily. On August 21, 2014, McGuire Unit 1 requested a Notice of Enforcement Discretion (NOED) in anticipation of exceeding TS 3.8.1 ""AC Sources - Operating"" Required Action Completion Time. The NOED was granted by the NRC on the same day. The cause of the EDG 1B cylinder 5L failure is high cycle fatigue of the inlet valve due to the combined effects of three inlet valve train parts which were manufactured outside of original equipment manufacturer (OEM) specified tolerances. Procurement of the applicable parts has been placed on hold until the parts specification is revised.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On November 18, 2024, at 0830, the 2-01 turbine driven auxiliary feedwater (TDAFW) pump was found in an inoperable condition following a change from Mode 4 to Mode 3 that occurred on 11/17/2024 at 1633. Operations personnel identified that the TDAFW remained uncoupled following maintenance during a Unit 2 refueling outage. Auxiliary feedwater (AFW) is required by Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operability (LCO) 3.7.5 to be operable in Modes 1, 2, and 3 with no exception allowed by TS LCO 3.0.4 for mode changes when applicable conditions are not met. The TDAFW was returned to service on November 18, 2024 at 2051. The cause was imprecise work instruction. This cause resulted in an incorrect interpretation of the work and post work testing scope. The applicable Maintenance procedure will be revised to correct the cause.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B)']
"On April 23, 2015, following an engineering evaluation, it was determined that during a period of 12 minutes from 14:05 to 14:17 Eastern Daylight Time on March 21, 2015, Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) 3 and 4 could potentially have been unable to tie to their respective emergency busses. This was due to relays in breaker control logic that were susceptible to electrical noise from nearby relays de-energizing that could have prevented the output breakers from properly closing under certain conditions. This is considered a loss of safety function of the onsite standby alternating current (AC) power source. Three of four EDGs are required to mitigate an accident on one unit while maintaining the other unit in a safe condition. The cause of EDG 3 and 4 loss of safety function was electrical noise that caused relays to oscillate, preventing the EDG output breakers from remaining closed. A relay model not susceptible to noise interference was installed in EDG 4 breaker control logic on March 22, 2015. A voltage transient suppression device was installed on EDG 3 breaker control logic on March 23, 2015.",['10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D)']
