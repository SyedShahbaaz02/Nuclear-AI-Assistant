# 🧾 ADAMS NRC API Downloader

A modular Python project that queries the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC) ADAMS public document database and
downloads filtered documents (PDFs) — starting with Licensee Event Reports (LERs) for August 2024.

Designed with extensibility in mind, this project supports future integration with Azure Blob Storage and other
filtering criteria such as keywords, docket numbers, and metadata extraction.
