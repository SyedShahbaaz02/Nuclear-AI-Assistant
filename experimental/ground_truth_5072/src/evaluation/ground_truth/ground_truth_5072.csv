"The reactor building DP became greater than -0.25"" H20 which rendered secondary containment inoperable due to not meeting SR 3.6.4.1.1. Due to troubleshooting efforts on the reactor building DP loop, the possibility existed that building DP would be affected as a part of the troubleshooting maintenance WO. Required actions of the TS were implemented, adjustments were made to the VR exhaust flow and reactor building DP was brought back into the green band, -0.5"" H20. A system walkdown validated the DP excursion was due to this planned evolution.",['50.72(b)(3)(v)(C)']
"During the OPEX review of Browns Ferry Fire Protection ENS 47374, ""DEFICIENCY IDENTIFIED IN TRANSITION TO PERFORMANCE BASED STANDARD FOR FIRE PROTECTION"", a similar condition was identified at Clinton Power Station. Specifically, at Browns Ferry, the wiring design for the station battery ammeter contains a ""shunt"" in the current flow off the battery. Bolted on the shunt bar are two leads to a current meter in the main control room. The tiny difference in voltage between the two taps on the shunt is enough to deflect the current gauge in the MCR when current flows from the battery thru the shunt. At Brown's Ferry, the ammeter wiring attached to the shunt does not have fuses. If these ammeter wires were grounded, shorted together, or open-circuited, there is no real affect to the battery. However, if one of these ammeter wires shorts to ground, at the same time another DC wire from the opposite polarity on the same battery also shorts to ground, a ground loop thru the unfused ammeter cable could occur. With enough current going thru the cable, the potential exists that a secondary fire in the raceway system could occur wherever the cable is routed. Review of the CPS design identified a similar condition, as no protective devices (fuses) are installed off of the shunts to the Main Control Room ammeters. The DC distribution system is a floating system with no established ground other than the high resistance ground provided through the ground detector. It is designed in this manner to allow the system to withstand one hard ground (zero resistance) with no adverse affect on the operation of any equipment fed from the DC system. If a second ground with low enough resistance is placed on the DC system, the operation of the grounded equipment could be adversely affected. The two ground paths could short around components to prevent them from operating or provide a current path to spuriously operate a piece of equipment. In the case of the Browns Ferry ENS described above, if one ammeter wire shorts to ground (which will be annunciated by the ground detection system), and a second ground develops on the opposite polarity of the same battery, a ground loop thru the unfused ammeter cable could occur. With enough current going thru the cable, the potential exists that a secondary fire in the raceway system could occur wherever the cable is routed. Schematic Diagrams/Drawings E02-1DC99-001 (1A), E02-1DC99-002 (1B), E02-1HP99-209 (1C), and E02-1DC99-003 (1D) were reviewed and confirmed this design configuration. In the Clinton Power Station Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR), Appendix F, Safe Shutdown Analysis, Section 1.5, Associated Circuits, describes that: The identification of associated circuits of concern is as follows: -Cables that have a common enclosure with safe shutdown cables and are not electrically protected by circuit breakers or fuses and are not provided with fire stops where they penetrate fire barriers are considered to be safe shutdown cables; however, this condition was not found to exist at Clinton. In summary, the Clinton UFSAR concluded that associated non-safe shutdown cables that are not electrically protected and share a common enclosure with safe shutdown cables do not exist at Clinton. The above scenario would not be in agreement with this statement. As such, this scenario is a violation of UFSAR Appendix F, Section 1.5 statements/commitments for circuit protection. Engineering reviewed the safety design basis for the Station Battery System and found that the design of this system meets all general design criteria and the requirements of IEEE 484 and IEEE 946. Illustrations in IEEE 946 show no fuses installed for a typical ammeter circuit from the battery shunts. Also, the S&L design standard for DC Aux Power Systems (ESC-291) does not specify fusing for the ammeter shunt circuit and references IEEE-946. Therefore, this condition affects CPS compliance to Appendix R and GL 81-12 but does not affect any TS and USAR described limits or functions of the DC auxiliary power system.",['50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B)']

"During the performance of shifting Main Control Room Ventilation from the A to B train the B Chiller breaker mechanism/charging motor was continuously and repeatedly cycling, resulting in the failure of the breaker. During the shifting of VC, the NLO called the MCR to inform us of a breaker giving off a cycling noise, NLO reported that the VC B chiller breaker was the source of the noise and was directed to shut down the VC B Chiller. Soon after the MCR received NSPS trouble and a Div 2 DC Ground. VC B was completely shut down by the MCR RO. NLO reported smoke coming from VC B chiller breaker cubicle. The WEC SRO, SM, and extra RO (incident commander) left the MCR to investigate the VC B breaker problem. Soon after arriving at 480V Unit Sub B, 0AP06E, it was apparent that the VC B chiller breaker needed to be immediately de-energized due to excessive smoke but no flame. After discussing actions that were needed to terminate the breaker failure, the field personnel de-energized 0AP06E by depressing that Unit Sub remote trip pushbutton.

"Operations personnel were attempting to dewater the Main Condenser East water box per LOP-CW-10, in conjunction with placement of C/O 64222. This was being done to support plugging of a suspected tube leak. The East water box had been isolated by electrically closing the 2CW007A and 2CW007C valves earlier in the day. An Operations supervisor and 2 EO's were attempting to torque the 2CW007A East water box valve into its seat to improve the isolation, using a torque sheet provided by Programs Engineering. The operators were also using match marks on the MOV actuator as a gage to determine if the valve was optimally in the seat. While torquing the 2CW007A valve closed, the EO's felt the wrench pop as the valve position indicator neared the closed match mark, and then noted the pointer move slightly past the mark. The operators stopped all valve work at that point.

"The Division 3 Diesel Ventilation System Supply Air Damper 1VD01YC did not open as expected during Division 3 VD fan start. System Managers and CMO personnel observed the supply damper and associated hydramotor, 1TZD003A, during the fan start. The hydramotor moved approximately one inch in the open direction but did not move the damper. After a few minutes of operation, the damper blades did open (approximately 10 to 20% open). When the fan was secured, the hydramotor closed the damper with a smooth motion. The damper control is designed to modulate the damper to maintain supply air temperature at a setpoint of 70 degrees. The damper should open on fan start if supply air temperature is greater than 70 degrees. The hydramotor receives a 4 to 20 milliamp signal from temperature controller 1TICVD003. At the time of fan start, Fan Room temperature was 81 degrees at the supply air sensor. The 1TICVD003 was set to 70 degrees and was reading 84 degrees. Therefore the damper should have opened on fan start. Additionally, CMO personnel observed that normally the damper fully opens on fan start and then modulates as needed. The hydramotor/damper assembly is fail-closed. In the judgment of the personnel observing the equipment, the three possible causes are: The hydramotor is not exerting the appropriate force to move the damper, the hydramotor is not receiving the correct signal from the controller, or the linkage is bound. The lowest linkage bar does appear to rub the hydramotor gearbox coupling when fully shut and may be adding resistance to the opening motion.",['50.72(b)(3)(v)(D)']

"The FP FASA team identified a potential noncompliance with the Safe Shutdown Analysis for a fire outside the DG rooms (fire zone CB-1e, CB-1f, CB-2 and CB-4). The CO2 panels for each DG train are all located in the same area outside the DG engine bay rooms (737 Control) and a fire in this area could cause fire damage to all three CO2 panels and/or wiring such that a trip (short) could be initiated to all three VD fans. Loss of the VD fans (1VD01CA, B and C) results in loss of cooling in the DG rooms and ultimately loss of the diesels. The availability of offsite power to the 4kv switchgear has not been analyzed for its availability in this fire area. The Fire Safe Shutdown Analysis (IP-M-0532) resolution codes 21 and 22 for this scenario directs operators to take manual control of the fans from the main control room and bypass the CO2 trip. This same language is also present in USAR Appendix F section 3.3.1.5 and IP-M-0471 Attachment 9. However, review of the associate ventilation fan and CO2 control schematics (E02-1VD99 sheets 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 and E02-1CO99 sheets 6, 7, 8) indicate that once the CO2 system actuates the VD fan is tripped (if running) and blocked from restarting with the trip/block signals remaining in place until manually reset at the local CO2 control panels (1CO05JA, B and C). Consequently, the MCR control switch cannot bypass the CO2 trip signal rendering all three DG units unavailable. Based on the FASA review, this issue appears to be a historical/legacy issue. Some variation does exist within each divisional VD fan control logic as follows: - 1VD01CA: Division 1 Diesel Generator 1A room vent fan: The standing CO2 trip signal can be bypassed through the remote shutdown panel allowing restart of the cooling fan. However, there is currently no procedural guidance to perform this action. - 1VD01CB: Division 2 Diesel Generator 1B room vent fan: The standing CO2 trip signal has no external bypass mechanism. In order to restart the Division 2 fan, the CO2 standing trip must be reset at the local panel (1CO05JB) or the trip removed via lifted lead in order to restore fan operation. - 1VD01CC: Division 3 Diesel Generator 1C room vent fan: The standing CO2 trip signal can be bypassed with the MCR fan start control switch. However, the switch is a spring return to auto that will result in the fan stopping if released. Continuous fan operation would require a dedicated operator or some other mechanism to maintain the switch in the close position. - 1H13-P839 fuse F3 (H/F1) provides power to the CO2 trip initiation logic relays that cause loss of all 3 divisional VD fans. Removal of the fuse will clear the trip/block interlocks allowing manual restart of the VD fans from the MCR. However, there is currently no procedural guidance to perform this action. (ref drawings E02-1VD99 sheet 7 and E02-1LV99 sheet 6) The FASA also identified incorrect and insufficient guidance for VD fan restoration in the event of fire induced circuit damage involving the DG CO2 protection system. CPS procedure 1893.04 (Appendix C steps 3.9 and 3.10) states to take manual control of the fans from the MCR per CPS procedure 3403.01. Review of 3403.01 section 8.8 (CO2 Initiation) simply states that ""when the CO2 initiation signal clears, start VD per section 8.1."" While it is true that VD can be started after the CO2 initiation signal is cleared, there is no guidance as to how this can be performed or accomplished.",['50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B)']

"At 10:37 an employee reported to the WEC SRO that the Door 247 (AUX BLDG CORRIDOR FROM AIRLOCK J-17) Magnetic Lock was non-functional. The employee was passing through door 247 when another individual was able to open Door 248 (RB side access to Airlock J-17 and gain access to the airlock. Both doors were open for approximately 5 seconds. The employee took control of door 247, restricted access and notified the WEC SRO. OCC MOM was contacted and EMD technicians responded to assess the deficiency. Tool pouch maintenance was authorized to perform repair. Based on discussion with the EMD manager, the cause of the malfunction was related to a fastener disengaging and preventing the magnetic lock from holding door 247 closed. The construction of the assembly is such that the proximity switch (which reports door status to the door logic) is fastened to the door with 6 fasteners. A steel plate is fastened to the proximity switch with one fastener (the plate is used to enforce the magnetic lock function). The fastener for the steel plate had disengaged, which prevents the magnetic lock from holding the door closed. Sequence of events: - Person on RB side pushes button (this prevents the AB side mag lock from deenergizing, however the interlock is not enforced due to the degraded steel plate fastener). - RB side person has to open a fire door before they open door 248 causing a delay in opening door 248 and the logic sensing that door 248 is open (logic triggers awareness alarms when a door is sensed open by the logic). - At the same time, person on AB side pushes button and opens door 247 (logic ignores this and maglock remains energized since a RB button was pushed first, however the maglock function is not enforced due to the degraded steel plate fastener). - RB side person opens door 248 since all permissives are met. Awareness alarms do not sound until door 248 is open, but only sounds on AB side (per design). Door 247 is already open. - Personnel take action to close both doors and contacted Operations to report deficiency. Door function: Ventilation Barrier Review: Impact on ventilation Systems: Doors #247 and #248 are part of Airlock No. J-17. Airlock No. J-17 separates the Unit 2 Reactor Building general access area at floor elevation 710'-6"" from Auxiliary Building Chemistry Lab/Office Area. The ventilation system(s) affected (VR and VL) are designed to maintain overall ambient temperatures in conformance with equipment requirements, and to maintain airflow patterns from accessible areas to potentially contaminated areas to provide protection from radioactive particulates. Normally Doors #247 and #248 are interlocked so both cannot be opened at the same time per Drawing A-447. Therefore, when door #247 is impaired, door #248 must be closed. Flood Barrier Review: Impact of Flood Protected Areas: Certain doors and structures are credited as flood barriers as shown on Figures 3.4-1 and 3.4-2. The subject door is located above grade at elevation 710'-6"" thus is not credited as a flood barrier. HELB Barrier Review: Impact of HELB protected area: Doors #247 and #248 are part of Airlock No. J-17. Airlock No. J-17 separates the Unit 2 Reactor Building general access area at floor elevation 710'-6"" from Auxiliary Building Chemistry Lab/Office Area. The Unit 2 Reactor Building general access area at floor elevation 710'-6"" is classified as EQ harsh subzone H4A per Figure 3.11-3 sheet 8. The Auxiliary Building Chemistry Lab/Office Area is classified as EQ mild zone N1 per Figure 3.11-5 sheet 4. AR 1570731 identified an issue with the latchsets associated with the secondary containment airlock doors that are shielding doors (including doors #247 and #248). In order for doors #247 and #248 to serve as HELB barriers they must remain closed when subject to loads associated with HELB pressure and a seismic event. The pressure acting on doors #247 and #248 due to a postulated HELB in the Unit 1 Reactor Building would act to open them (reference drawing A-185). For these doors to remain closed during a postulated HELB the latchset must be capable of withstanding the loads associated with HELB pressure and a seismic event. Similar latchsets were evaluated in Design Analysis L-001661; however this design analysis is only applicable to regular doors and not shielding doors. The loads acting on the shielding doors include the door weight, HELB, and Seismic which are significantly greater than the loads acting on regular doors. This is primarily due to the shield doors being significantly heavier than the regular doors. Design Analysis L-001661 documents that the latchsets can accommodate a load of 1124 pounds, which exceeds the HELB and seismic loads acting on regular doors. However this load capacity is less than the HELB & seismic loads acting on the above shield doors. Thus the shield doors #247 and #248 should not be credited as HELB barriers. The regular door #886 provides access to shield door #248, and this door is credited as the HELB barrier for Airlock No. J-17. Door #886 opens into the Unit 2 RB general access area per drawing A-185, so a HELB would force door #886 closed. Missile Barrier Review: Impact on Missile Protected area: Only plant doors #19 and #20 are credited as missile barriers. Thus door #247 is not credited as a missile barrier. Occupational Radiation Protection Barrier Review: Impact of RPA: Door 248 must remain closed when door 247 is open to prevent the potential spread of contamination. Post-Accident Radiation EQ Barrier Review: Impact of equipment qualification: Doors #247 and #248 are part of Airlock No. J-17. Airlock No. J-17 separates the Unit 2 Reactor Building general access area at floor elevation 710'-6"" from Auxiliary Building Chemistry Lab/Office Area. The Unit 2 Reactor Building general access area at floor elevation 710'-6"" is classified as EQ harsh subzone H4A per Figure 3.11-3 sheet 8. The Auxiliary Building Chemistry Lab/Office Area is classified as EQ mild zone N1 per Figure 3.11-5 sheet 4. Also Doors #247 and #248 are shielding doors per the Door Schedule, drawing A-447. Also per Calc L-002522 the calculated accident dose for EQ harsh subzone H4A (7.89x10E6 rads) which is greater than the calculated accident dose for EQ mild zone N1 (3.82x10E2 rads). Thus Doors #247 and #248 are credited as post-accident radiation EQ barriers. Therefore, Door #248 shall remain closed when Door #247 is open (impaired).",['50.72(b)(3)(v)(C)']

"During the 2014 NRC Triennial Fire Protection inspection, the NRC requested breaker fuse coordination analysis for the RCIC valves 2E51-F045 and 2E51-F019 supplied by 250 VDC MCC 221Y. These RCIC valves can be operated from the Remote Shutdown Panel in case of a fire in the main control room. As described in IR 2421318, the concern is that for a fire in the control room, a short in the control circuit may cause the associated 250 VDC breaker to trip before the 10A protective fuse in the circuit blows. If the feed breaker trips before the protective fuse, the valve cannot be operated from the Remote Shutdown Panel unless the breaker is reset. RCIC operation from the RSP is the method credited in the FPR for vessel inventory make up in the event of a fire in the main control room. Engineering has completed a preliminary review of all 28 affected RCIC valves and RCIC instrumentation on the Remote Shutdown Panel (RSP) and identified a total of 16 division 1 valves (8 per Unit) that have been preliminary evaluated for the breaker/fuse coordination issue. The RCIC valves on the division 2 portion of the RSP (480 VAC) and the RSP Instrumentation (including flow and turbine speed) supplied by 125 VDC are not affected by the preliminary breaker/fuse coordination issue. In addition, the RCIC containment isolation valves are supplied by 480 VAC and are not affected by the issue. It is understood that fire can potentially cause spurious operation or breaker trip, prior to transferring control to the RSP. In addition, LaSalle must postulate that a spurious operation can occur on any one of the affected valves prior to arriving at the RSP. However, the characteristics and type of combustible cable used at LaSalle (IEEE 383 qualified thermoset instead of thermoplastic), the incipient fire development and the magnitude of the fire in the first four minutes of the event, and the results of recent NRC cable testing programs, it is very unlikely that a spurious operation or breaker trip would occur In the first four minutes of the event, but if the fault occurred, it would most likely be due to a single conductor fault to ground that causes the breaker to fail in its current position. The 16 affected valves were checked to see if they are in the correct position when the breaker trips. A summary of each affected valve and what it takes to eliminate the breaker coordination issue is as follows: Impact of no power to the following valves on Unit-1 1E51-F010 . is the normal suction source from the CST and is a normally open valve (will not affect RSP operations). 1E51-F022 . is the normally closed full flow test valve used to throttle RCIC pressure during quarterly testing in the CST to CST mode. Power would have to be restored or manually opened before the valve is used for testing. This valve would not stop RCIC injection to the reactor. 1E51-F046 . is a normally closed valve when RCIC is not in operation that provides lube oil cooling for the RCIC turbine. This valve will not open until the breaker is reset. Based on reviews as part of Extended Power Uprate (EPU) (not official Engineering document at this time) and room temperature there is approximately 3 hours of run time before reaching maximum recommended lube oil temp of 235 degrees. 1E51-F031 . Is the normally closed suction source from the suppression pool. With no power the valve will not be able to automatically open on a low CST level. Based on coping for station blackout there is approximately 4 hours before this swap occurs. There is CST level remaining prior to the need to swap over to the suppression pool. 1E51-F360 . is the normally latched open trip and throttle valve. With the valve being open a steam source is available to the turbine. Will still trip on mechanical overspeed of the turbine and cannot be electrically cycled open with no power. The valve is in the correct position for RSP operations. 1E51-F068 . is a normally open valve and is the steam return (exhaust) to the suppression pool. This is the correct position for RSP operations. With this valve open the turbine will have an available exhaust path. 1E51-F069 . is a normally open valve for the barometric condenser vacuum pump discharge. This is the correct position for RSP operations. With the valve open the removal of the non- condensable gases will still be available. 1E51-F080 . is a normally open vacuum breaker line isolation valve. This is the correct position for RSP operations. With the valve open air will still be allowed to be drawn into the exhaust line to prevent water hammer. Impact of no power to the following valves on Unit-2 2E51-F010 . is the normal suction source from the CST and is a normally open valve. This is the correct position for RSP operations. 2E51-F059 . is the normally closed full flow test valve used during quarterly testing in the CST to CST mode. Power would have to be restored or manually opened if using for pressure control. 2E51-F046 . is a normally closed valve when RCIC is not in operation that provides lube oil cooling for the turbine. Based on reviews as part of EPU (not official Engineering document at this time) there is approximately 3 hours of run time before reaching maximum recommended lube oil temp of 235 degrees. 2E51-F031 . Is the normally closed suction source from the suppression pool. With no power the valve will not be able to automatically open on a low CST level. Based on coping for station blackout there is approximately 4 hours before this swap occurs. There is CST level remaining prior to the need to swap over to the suppression pool. 2E51-F360 . is the normally open trip and throttle valve. With the valve being open a steam source is available to the turbine. Will still trip on mechanical overspeed of the turbine and cannot be electrical cycled open with no power. 2E51-F068 . is a normally open valve and is the steam return (exhaust) to the suppression pool. This is the correct position for RSP operations. With this valve open the turbine will have an available exhaust path. 2E51-F069 . is a normally open valve for the barometric condenser vacuum pump. With the valve open the removal of the non- condensable gases will still be available. This is the correct position for RSP operations. 2E51-F080 . is the normally open vacuum line isolation. With the valve open air will still be allowed to be drawn into the exhaust line to prevent water hammer. This is the correct position for RSP operations. In summary, based on the preliminary results, four breakers in Unit 1 need to be changed with a breaker that has a larger continuous amp rating and eight breakers per unit require a change to their trip settings. Going forward, NRC IN Notice 97-48 has been reviewed for inadequate or inappropriate interim FP Compensatory Measures and that guidance will be implemented as required.

"During the Braidwood NRC FP inspection, an inspector identified a circuit deficiency for which a design basis fire in the Main Control Room could prevent the Pressurizer PORV Block Valves from being closed from the local control switches at their associated MCCs (Reference Braidwood IRs #02542045 and #02544447). Byron Engineering has reviewed this issue and determined that this issue is also applicable to Byron Station. The close coil seal-in contact connection to the Main Control Room is not completely isolated by the local/remote transfer switch, and a potential fire induced ground in the Main Control Room could clear the associated local control power fuses, which would prevent the valve from operating at the local control switch. For a Main Control Room fire, the concern is that a hot short could cause the PORV to spuriously open, and then a ground fault on the PORV Block Valve control circuit could prevent the Block Valve from being manually closed by operating the local control switch at the MCC. Section 2.4.3.2 of the Fire Protection Report (FPR) Safe Shutdown Analysis (SSA) generically addresses the Pressurizer PORVs and Block Valves as follows: ""A ""remote/local"" isolation switch and control switch are provided for the block valve at its motor control center, located in the Division 11(21) electrical penetration area. The block valve can be closed by placing the ""remote/local"" isolation switch in ""Local"" and then closing the valve with the control switch provided."" (Note that a similar statement is also included for the Div. 12(22) PORV Block Valves, with the exception that the Div. 12(22) MCCs are located in the Division 12(22) electrical penetration area.) Followed by: ""In fire zones where one of the PORVs has a control cable present in the zone that can spuriously open the PORV and its associated block valve does not have AC power available, the PORV will be failed closed by pulling its control power fuse at its DC distribution panel."" The current licensing basis in the SSA classifies the PORVs/Block Valves as a High/Low pressure interface. For High/Low pressure interface components, the SSA states: ""2-wire ungrounded dc circuit cable-to-cable proper polarity faults are considered to be credible, and must be evaluated."" Procedural guidance for implementing the SSA requirements for an MCR fire is provided in BOP FR-1T38 and 1(2)BOA PRI-5. Step 19 on Page 6 of BOP FR-1T38, Fire Zone 2.1-0 Main Control Room 1D-75, credits closing a Pressurizer PORV Block Valve using the local control switch to mitigate the consequences of a fire-induced spurious opening of a Pressurizer PORV. Additionally, Procedure BOP FP-100T38 would be used in conjunction with Procedure 1(2)BOA PRI-5. Step 15.a.2 of Procedure 1(2)BOA PRI-5 directs the operator to close the block valves locally at their associated MCCs. Step 15.a.3 states that if any PORV block valve cannot be closed, then locally remove the PORV control power fuses to fail its associated PORV closed. Pulling the PORV fuses would prevent a conductor-to-conductor hot short from spuriously opening the valve; however, pulling the PORV fuses would not prevent another DC cable from having two cable-to-cable proper polarity faults with the PORV cable and spuriously energizing the PORV. Therefore, a fire-induced spurious opening of a PORV due to cable-to-cable hot shorts, along with inadequate separation of the local and remote control circuits for the Block Valves, could adversely affect the current mitigation strategy for spurious opening of a Pressurizer PORV due to a fire. A review of the PORV and BLOCK Valve circuits identified 8 additional zones, for a total of 9 fire zones, where both the PORV and Block Valve circuits are routed and could potentially be subject to this concern. The fire zones are as follows: 2.1-0 (Main Control Room) 3.2B-1 (LCSR Zone B-1) 3.2C-1 (LCSR Zone C-1) 3.2B-2 (LCSR Zone B-2) 3.2C-2 (LCSR Zone C-2) 3.3B-1 (UCSR Zone B-1) 3.3C-1 (UCSR Zone C-1) 3.3C-2 (UCSR Zone C-2) 3.3D-2 (UCSR Zone D-2)",['50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B)']

"During the 2016 Braidwood NRC CDBI Inspection, the inspection team requested information supporting the acceptability of locating the combustion air intake for the B-train AFW diesel engines in the turbine building. There was no specific concern of interest identified by the inspection team. During the review of available documentation related to the B-train AFW diesel engine air intake, it was identified that the documentation did not support operation of the diesel with HELB environmental conditions postulated in the turbine building. Specifically, prior evaluations did not account for air displacement by steam release in the event. Reviewing the current turbine building HELB analysis, the data provided for Main Steam, Heater Drain and Feedwater breaks on the 401' elevation indicate conditions in the area of the air intake would not support AFW diesel operation. The steam generated during the event displaces enough air in the area to drop the air mass fraction below the level necessary to support fuel combustion. The current Braidwood Design Basis requires protection of safe shutdown capabilities in the event of a piping failure combined with a single active failure with or without offsite power. The AFW system is essential for safe shutdown of the plant following piping failures in the main steam, heater drain and feedwater systems. Either AFW pump (A-train or B-train) is capable of supporting the safe shutdown function. Under the Main Steam break, steam release to the turbine building is terminated by prompt closure of the MSIV. This action protects the B-train AFW pump. Assuming a single active failure (MSIV failure to close), the B-train AFW pump would not be capable of operating due to the lack of combustion air at the intake. The safe shutdown function is maintained by the A-train AFW pump with or without offsite power. The Main Steam break does not challenge the HELB safe shutdown function. Under the Heater Drain system break, the current turbine building HELB GOTHIC model was utilized to determine actual air mass fractions available on the 401' elevation of the turbine building. The current GOTHIC model uses very conservative M&E releases since the installation of the new HELB dampers provided sufficient protection of safety related equipment to preclude the need to further refine break flows. The current modeled Heater Drain system break flows were left excessively conservative since the new HELB barriers could accommodate the resulting conditions. To ascertain the actual environmental conditions near the B-train AFW diesel, the GOTHIC model was adjusted using more realistic break flows established during the prior HELB resolution effort. The environmental conditions resulting from the postulated Heater Drain system break using break flows from prior evaluations supports 1B AFW diesel engine operation. There is sufficient air density in the turbine building near the intake for proper engine combustion. Under the Feedwater break, the break occurs in the area of the B-train AFW combustion air intake and there is no automatic isolation feature that would prevent undesirable conditions in the turbine building. In this event, a single failure could involve failure of the A-train AFW system which would result in a failure of the safe shutdown AFW function. Braidwood Engineering has reviewed the feedwater system piping stress analyses and confirmed piping meets HELB analysis related stress allowable to preclude pipe breaks in the turbine building. Braidwood Engineering is currently reviewing associated piping support calculations to confirm the piping supports maintain structural integrity for the piping loads generated by the analysis. At this time, several supports have been identified with pipe applied loads in excess of design basis support load allowable values. A Technical Call was completed with appropriate piping support analysis subject matter experts. The consensus of the Technical Call was that the use of alternative pipe system analysis combined with detailed analysis of individual pipe supports would produce acceptable results that demonstrate feedwater piping breaks need not be postulated.

"This IR identifies a nonconforming condition in our design such that ventilation openings in the L line wall above 451' elevation and the RWST tank roof hatches are not considered to be adequately protected from tornado missiles as described in our licensing basis. The NRC has provided guidance for such issues in Enforcement Guidance Manual (EGM) 15-002, ENFORCEMENT DISCRETION FOR TORNADO-GENERATED MISSILE PROTECTION NONCOMPLIANCE, and Interim Staff Guidance DSS-ISG-2016-01, Clarification of Licensee Actions in Receipt of Enforcement Discretion Per Enforcement Guidance Memorandum EGM 15-002. This IR documents the nonconforming condition and the implementation of EGM 15-002 and DSS-ISG-2016-01 to transition the SSC's from inoperable to operable but nonconforming. This IR documents that initial compensatory measures are in place, tracks development of longer term comprehensive compensatory measures (within 60 days) and tracks resolution of issue (by 6/10/2018). GDC Criterion 4 requires SSCs important to safety shall be appropriately protected against dynamic effects including missiles. The Braidwood SER states that all safety related systems and components are located within tornado-missile-protected structures, or are provided with tornado-missile barriers or other protection (such as burial underground), or are orientated so that tornado missiles do not present a safety hazard with the exception of the DG exhaust stacks, and MS safety and relief valve exhaust stacks. As described in UFSAR Section 3.3.2.2.2 all siding and roof decking above the floor at elevation 451 feet is designed to blow off at tornado pressures exceeding 105 psf. The subject ventilation openings in the L-line wall above 451' elevation and the RWST hatches are not fully protected from tornado missiles nor accepted as adequately protected during original licensing. The following items could be impacted by tornado missiles entering the 0A and 0B MCR turbine building intake openings: Main control room pressurization, main control room ductwork and dampers, chilled water to the VC coils, main control room radiation monitors. The following items could be impacted by tornado missiles entering the Division 11 and 21 MEER rooms: Exhaust from the MEER (affects room cooling and MCR pressure), exhaust from a battery room, conduits and cabinets associated with the battery chargers and DC bus. The following items could be impacted by tornado missiles entering the Division 12 and 22 MEER rooms: Exhaust from the MEER (affects room cooling and MCR pressure), MEER supply fan and ductwork, battery room exhaust, and the instrument inverter cabinets. The Aux Feed Diesel exterior exhaust stacks (which extend from the roofline) could be impacted by tornado missiles. While we have analyses on these impacts, they do not use a NRC accepted methodology to evaluate the impact and effects. The RWST roof access opening Bilco hatch is fabricated from sheet metal that is not designed to prevent all postulated tornado missiles from entering the tank. The following items could be impacted by tornado missiles entering the RWST roof access. The tank pressure boundary is 24"" thick concrete and is designed to withstand an external tornado missile impact. Thus a missile that enters the tank will not adversely impact the tank pressure boundary. The 6"" RWST recirculation pipe, 3"" overflow pipe, and 24"" suction pipe are located inside the tank are approximately 130 degrees around the tank away from the hatch opening. Although the likelihood of a tornado missile traversing through the unprotected opening and damaging equipment resulting in a loss of function is low, it is possible that a tornado missile hit on one or more of the items listed above could result in the loss of the associated Technical Specification safety function. The NRC has issued EGM 15-002 for when an operating power licensee does not comply with a plant's current site specific licensing basis for tornado generated missile protection. If the licensee cannot perform the applicable TS LCO required action(s) or restore compliance within the completion time allowed by the LCO, the EGM provides enforcement discretion when a licensee implements initial compensatory measures prior to expiration for the time allowed by the LCO. As described in DSS-ISG-2016-01 the initial compensatory measures should be in place and the action for the EGM should be verified as current and readily deployable within a very short time frame. The DSS-ISG states: ""The following initial compensatory measures should be completed before the expiration of the TS action statement allowed outage time: 1. Verify that procedures are in place and training is current for performing actions in response to a tornado, such as: a. The affected unit's abnormal and emergency operating procedures addressing tornados/high winds, and the loss of the tornado missile vulnerable equipment. b. The affected unit's Diverse and Flexible Coping Strategies (FLEX) equipment and procedures, if available. If site FLEX equipment and procedures are not available, specific measures should be put in place with equipment staged, procedures written, and training completed for actions to lessen the likelihood of tornado missile effects on the affected SSCs, or for prompt recovery of SSC function from tornado missile effects. 2. Verify that procedures are in place and training is current for the following actions to be taken if a tornado watch is issued for the area, such as: a. Remove, relocate, or secure potential missiles. b. From a work management/configuration control perspective, protect equipment important to maintaining safe shutdown conditions. c. Promptly complete or restore equipment from maintenance activities in progress on equipment important to maintaining safe shutdown conditions. d. Restore equipment important to maintaining safe shutdown conditions if undergoing maintenance or testing, if possible. e. Verify equipment is ready to use by visual inspection, surveillances and preventive maintenance are current, and review pending equipment maintenance requests. 3. Verify that procedures are in place and training is current for actions to be taken if a tornado warning is issued for the area, such as: a. Warning and protection strategies for site personnel. b. Strategies for prompt damage assessment and initiation of restorative actions (e.g., pre-staging of equipment and plant staff at safe, strategic locations to promptly implement any necessary mitigative actions). 4. Establish a heightened level of station awareness and preparedness relative to identified tornado missile vulnerabilities. This can be accomplished by including: a. A description of the nonconforming SSC(s) and the associated compensatory measures in the shift manager turnover notes. b. Discussing these actions during shift turnover briefings, and c. Including the compensatory actions in the operability determination documentation maintained in the control room."" The shift manager is aware of these initial compensatory actions and has adequate procedures and training to assure these actions are taken. As part of long term corrective actions, additional measures are planned to more efficiently assimilate these actions into site processes as well as train others. Therefore, with the writing of this IR and including this IR in the shift manager turnover briefings, these initial compensatory measures are considered current and readily deployable and thereby meet the requirements of EGM implementation. Per the DSS-ISG: ""Once enforcement discretion due to inoperability of SSC(s) for tornado missile protection considerations is implemented, the SSCs that were determined to be inoperable should be considered ""operable but non-conforming."" To document the implementation of the EGM, licenses should declare (log) the inoperability of the SSC(s), establishment of initial compensatory measures, and use of EGM 15-002 to establish justification for transition of SSC(s) from inoperable to operable but non-conforming. Additionally the licensee is expected to inform the resident inspector. The enforcement discretion does not relieve the licensees of any reporting requirements required in 10 CFR for inoperable TS-required SSCs. The operable but non-conforming condition would be justified by the licensee's implementation of initial compensatory measures, with the understanding that comprehensive compensatory measures would be implemented within 60 days."" Therefore, further actions to document implementation of EGM 15-002 include: 1. Review this IR in shift manager turnover briefings until longer term actions can be put in place regarding initial compensatory actions. Operating to confirm that initial compensatory actions are in place and that issue has been added to shift manager turnover, in Operations review of IR. 2. Declare (log) the inoperability of the SSC(s), establishment of initial compensatory measures, and use of EGM 15-002 to establish justification for transition of SSC(s) from inoperable to operable but non-conforming. 3. Inform resident inspector. 4. Determine reporting requirements required in 10 CFR for inoperable TS-required SSCs. This will be included in Operations response in IR. 5. Create action to develop longer term comprehensive compensatory measures, due in 60 days. Create standing PHC agenda item to bring status of long term actions to PHC, due in two weeks. Regarding longer term comprehensive compensatory measures, the DSS-ISG further states: ""For longer term comprehensive compensatory measures, the licensee will have extended time to evaluate specific strategies for protection of affected, opposite train, and alternate equipment; restoration plans including consideration for additional equipment to include under FLEX or other onsite inventories; and operational considerations in recognition to the extent of the nonconformance. Comprehensive compensatory measures should be completed as soon as practicable, but no later than 60 days after identification of the affected SSC(s) for enforcement discretion to remain in effect. The following comprehensive compensatory measures should be completed no later than 60 days following identification of nonconformance(s), such as: 1. Maintain initial compensatory actions, as appropriate. 2. Implement additional detailed actions. Examples may include specific measures with equipment staged, procedures written, and training completed for actions to lessen the likelihood of tornado missile effects on the affected SSCs or for prompt recovery of SSC function from tornado missile effects. Ensure any equipment and procedures necessary for these compensatory actions are staged in areas protected from exposure to tornado events, but will be promptly accessible. In order for enforcement discretion to apply, the licensee's additional actions should demonstrate a discernable change from its pre-discovery actions. Temporary modifications may be chosen to reduce the likelihood of damage to affected SSCs from tornado missiles, but are not expected for initial compensatory measures nor required for comprehensive compensatory measures."" 6. Create action to fully resolve issue by June 10, 2018, per EGM 15-002.","['50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B)', '50.72(b)(3)(v)(D)']"

"This IR identifies a non-conforming condition with the EDG exhaust stacks with respect to tornado missile protection and, if they are determined to be inoperable, provides for application of NRC enforcement discretion to allow diesel generators E1, E2, E3 and E4 to be returned to an operable status. As documented in IR 322722, the EDG exhaust stacks at PB extend approximately 7 feet above the roof of the diesel building and are not protected against tornado missiles. This was determined to be acceptable at the time the IR was evaluated because it was assumed only one missile strike had to be considered and the plant can be safely shutdown with three diesels. NRC actions since that time have shown that multiple missiles need to be considered and that all four EDGs need to be capable of performing their design function following a tornado. Peach Bottom's licensing basis for tornado missile protection is contained in the following: UFSAR Section C.2.4: ""Components which directly affect the ultimate safe shutdown of the plant are located either in reinforced concrete structures or underground for tornado protection. These components include . . . standby diesel generators."" UFSAR Section H.2.1: ""Essential structures and equipment are designed to performance standards which enable the facility to withstand, without loss of capability to protect the public, the additional forces that might be imposed by natural phenomena such as . . . tornados."" UFSAR Section 8.5 states that each diesel generator is protected against natural phenomena, such as tornadoes. Since the exhaust stacks are an integral component of the EDG and are not protected against tornado missiles, the design does not meet the licensing basis and a non-conforming condition exists. As stated in OP-AA-108-115, ""Operability Determinations"" (which is based on NRC Inspection Manual 0326), in order to be considered operable, a component must be capable of performing its specified safety function within the required range of design physical conditions. IR 322722 assignment 03 determined that a design basis missile strike of the upper half of the exhaust stack could bend the stack sufficiently to affect operation of the engine. The NRC reviewed a similar issue at a plant with a similar licensing basis (Point Beach) and stated in TIA 2012-07 (ML12115A080) that EDGs are expected to survive a tornado with the capability to perform their safety function intact. Tornados are part of the required range of design physical conditions in which the EDGs must be able to operate. The NRC reviewed issues related to tornado missile protection in RIS 2015-06 (ML15020A419). Licensees that identify tornado generated missile non-compliances that result in a TS LCO required shutdown may receive enforcement discretion. The EGM allows SSCs to be restored to an operable but non-conforming status provided certain compensatory measures are taken. SSCs that are determined to be inoperable should be declared (logged) as inoperable, the initial compensatory measures should be implemented, and the SSC should be declared operable but non-conforming by applying EGM 15-002. Additional compensatory measures specific to the vulnerability must be implemented within 60 days. The enforcement discretion will remain in effect for 5 years after the issuance of RIS 2015-06 (6/10/15) for Group B plants, which includes Peach Bottom. The enforcement discretion does not relieve the licensee of any reporting requirements. The resident inspector has been informed of this issue and of the intent to utilize enforcement discretion. Extent of Condition After issuance of ISG-2016-01 in February 2016, Exelon Corporate Engineering initiated a project to identify the licensing basis for tornado missiles at all Exelon plants. Corporate Engineering also contracted with S&L to perform plant walkdowns at Exelon sites to identify potential vulnerabilities. S&L has completed their walkdown at Peach Bottom and a report of potential vulnerabilities has been provided to the site. Because S&L was not fully knowledgeable of the licensing and design basis of the plant, additional review is being performed by PEDM to identify any non-compliances. Cause This is a design issue not recognized during the original licensing of the plant. Other plants have identified similar non-conformances, and the NRC determined that a period of enforcement discretion was appropriate to allow the industry to resolve the non-compliances. Related Issues at other Exelon plants IR 2673848 and IR 2673854 were initiated at Byron and Braidwood for nonconforming conditions related to tornado missile protection.","['50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B)', '50.72(b)(3)(v)(D)']"

"This IR identifies a non-conforming condition with the Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) Main Fuel Oil (FO) Storage tank vents with respect to tornado missile protection. Since the fuel oil supply (with the vent pipe) is an integral component of the EDG's and is not protected against tornado missiles, the design does not meet the licensing basis and a non-conforming condition exists. This design vulnerability applies to all three of Dresden's main fuel oil tank vents (EDG Fuel Oil Tank Vent Pipes: 2-5214-3"", 3-5214-3"" and 2/3-5214-3""). Since the vent piping for each main fuel oil tank is not protected from missiles, an event can be postulated that the vent piping becomes plugged or blocked from relieving negative pressure inside the main fuel oil tank while the day tank is being replenished. The EDGs would be expected to start and run until the day tank is depleted (approximately 4 hours). If the obstruction is not removed to allow the main storage tanks (EDG Fuel Oil Tanks: 2-5201, 3-5201, 2/3-5201) to equalize with atmospheric pressure, the fuel oil transfer pumps would lose the ability to refill the day tank and the EDGs would have no fuel oil for continued operation. NRC Enforcement Guidance Memorandum EGM 15-002, Revision 1, provides for application of NRC enforcement discretion which allows the diesel generators U2 Emergency Diesel Generator, 2/3 Emergency Diesel Generator and U3 Emergency Diesel Generator to be returned to an operable status based on the application of Compensatory Measures which are intended to minimize the likelihood that the tornado event would result in a failure of the EDGs. Application of the guidance in EGM 15-002, revision 1, and, NRC DSS-ISG-2016-01, revision 1, Appendix A, describes acceptable initial and comprehensive compensatory measures necessary to ensure that the identified nonconforming condition in this issue report can be treated by the NRC with enforcement discretion. The measures listed below should be verified as current and readily deployable within a very short timeframe. The resident inspector has been informed of this issue and of the intent to utilize enforcement discretion in accordance with EGM 15-002 (Rev 1). Extent of Condition: In August of 2015, Exelon Corporate Engineering initiated a project to identify the licensing basis for tornado-generated missiles at all Exelon plants. A report of initial potential vulnerabilities was generated using overly conservative assumptions (EC 404048). Additional reviews are being performed by Dresden Engineering and other departments with final discovery to be completed and documented in EC 619558. Cause: This is a legacy design issue not recognized during the original licensing of the plant. Other plants have identified similar non-conformance, and the NRC determined that a period of enforcement discretion was appropriate to allow the industry to resolve the non-compliances.","['50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B)', '50.72(b)(3)(v)(D)']"
"This IR identifies a non-conforming condition with the Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) intake and exhaust stacks, fuel oil tank vents, and day tank vents with respect to tornado missile protection. If any of these lines were to become crimped by a missile impact, the associated EDG could become inoperable. The NRC has provided guidance for such issues in Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 15-002, Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2015-06, and Interim Staff Guidance DSS-ISG-2016-01. This IR documents the non-conforming condition and the implementation of EGM 15-002 to transition the SSCs from inoperable to operable but non-conforming. This IR documents that initial compensatory measures are in place, tracks development of longer term compensatory measures (within 60 days), and tracks resolution of the issue (by June 10, 2018), per the EGM 15-002 and DSS-ISG-2016-01. EC 619116 documents the evaluation performed to determine what, if any, non-conforming conditions regarding tornado missile protection exist. This evaluation addresses all components required for safe shutdown that are vulnerable to a tornado missile strike. Due to the ambiguity in the licensing basis, with regard to exterior missiles, the EDG intake and exhaust stacks, fuel oil tank vents, and day tank vents are conservatively being identified as non-conforming. The NRC reviewed issues related to tornado missile protection in RIS 2015-06. Licensees that identify tornado generated missile non-compliances that result in a Tech Spec (TS) LCO required shutdown may receive enforcement discretion as described in EGM 15-002. SSCs that are determined to be inoperable should be declared (logged) as inoperable, initial compensatory measures should be implemented and the SSC can be declared operable but non-conforming. Per EGM 15-002, additional compensatory measures specific to the vulnerability must be implemented within 60 days. The enforcement discretion will remain in effect for 3 years after the issuance of RIS 2015-06 (to 06/10/18). The enforcement discretion does not relieve the licensee of any reporting requirements. The resident inspector has been informed of this issue and of the intent to utilize enforcement discretion in accordance with EGM 15-002. EGM 15-002 states, ""The staff will exercise this enforcement discretion only when a licensee implements initial compensatory measures prior to the expiration of the time allowed by the LCO that provide additional protection such that the likelihood of tornado missile effects are lessened."" The EGM provides examples of potential compensatory measures that may be taken to lessen the effects of tornado missiles. The examples listed are: a)Development and implementation of procedures and conduct of training for plant staff in performing compensatory and mitigating actions related to tornado missile impact effects on identified safety-related SSCs, b)Actions to be taken if a tornado watch is predicted or issued for the area to secure potential missiles, protect equipment that could affect safety-related SSC operation, cease maintenance activities in progress on equipment that could affect availability of SSCs, repair/restore SSCs if undergoing maintenance, stage equipment necessary for mitigative actions in protected but promptly accessible locations, and c)Actions to be taken if a tornado warning is issued for the area (e.g., pre-staging of plant staff at safe, strategic locations to promptly implement mitigative actions, and alerting plant staff necessary for prompt mitigative actions of preparation for response following severe weather conditions). Procedures QCOA 0010-10 (Tornado Watch/Warning, Severe Thunderstorm Warning, or Severe Winds) and OP-AA-108-111-1001 (Severe Weather and Natural Disaster Guidelines) contain the existing Quad Cities compensatory measures as required by the EGM. These two procedures are entered concurrently when the entry conditions exist. Step D.10 of QCOA 0010-10 describes actions to consider if a tornado watch or severe thunderstorm is issued for an area that includes Quad Cities Station (upper Rock Island County). Actions to consider are: Designate personnel to inspect the site for potential missiles and secure the items as necessary. Verify the Unit 1, Unit 2 and Unit 1/2 Emergency Diesel Generators are available. If minor maintenance is being performed or short duration Clearance Orders are in effect on any Diesel Generator, consider returning the Emergency Diesel Generator to available status. If the Unit 2 125 VDC Alternate Battery is supplying Station loads, consider transferring back to the Normal Unit 2 125 VDC Battery. If the 345 kV ring bus is open, or is planned to be opened, for maintenance, consider taking actions to restore the ring bus as soon as possible and delay the planned maintenance. Review in-progress and planned work activities and consider expediting in-progress work and/or delaying upcoming work on systems needed to mitigate a loss of off-site power, mitigate transients, or place the Unit in a Cold Shutdown condition. If FLEX equipment is located external to the building for surveillance testing, then curtail the testing and return all equipment to storage. Procedure OP-AA-108-111-1001, Step 4.3 (Guidelines for High Winds and Tornados) provides similar guidance for preemptive actions that are contained in QCOA 0010-10. Once the storm has passed, Step D.16 of QCOA 0010-10 describes actions to compensate for potential damage to the Emergency Diesel Generator's intake and/or exhaust stacks. This step states, ""If damage to any EDG's intake or exhaust piping is sufficient to consider the particular EDG inoperable, then the damaged portion of piping can be removed by any available means to allow operation of the subject EDG.""","['50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B)', '50.72(b)(3)(v)(D)']"

"IR#4495001 was previously generated for an indication identified as part of ultrasonic testing of Penetration 75 of the U2 Reactor Head per WO# 05100141-01. When the issue report was generated, it was assumed that the flaw was only in one of the welds that acts as an anti-rotation device to prevent vibrations experienced during normal operations from causing the funnel to 'un-screw' and become detached from the nozzle (see attached photograph for reference). The weld itself is non-ASME, non-safety related and this was stated in the original IR. However, upon further review of the UT data contained in Framatome report INR-B2R23-UT-75, it has been identified that the location of the indication is NOT in the weld but in the actual CETC nozzle itself near the root of the weld. Specifically, the indication is located at 184 degrees with a length of 0.197"" with a measured depth of 0.141"" from the outer diameter surface and extends from 1.498"" to 1.695"" from the end of the nozzle.

"This IR is being written as a follow-up IR upon receipt of an NRC violation as part of the 2012 PI&R FASA (IR 1338977). THIS ACTION IS CLOSED. This IR is being generated to meet the requirements of LS-AA-1003. Per the procedure, once an NRC Inspection Report is issued with a Finding or Violation, the NRC Coordinator is responsible for generating an IR that requires the responsible organization to review the NRC Violation and ensure the Station response and corrective actions properly address the violation. From the 2010 NRC 4th Quarter Integrated Inspection Report (2010-005). The inspectors determined that the issue is closed: (Closed) Licensee Event Report 05000457/2010-002-00: Containment Spray Pump Suction Valve Failed to Close Resulting in Unanalyzed Plant Condition Due to Procedure Error. On June 17, 2010, Unit 2 containment spray (CS) pump suction valve 2CS009B failed to close during a quarterly surveillance test. Upon evaluation of the potential consequences of this failure, the licensee identified and reported an 8-hour non-emergency unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety. The licensee manually restored the valve to the normally closed position, eliminating the condition. During a loss-of-coolant accident, both the emergency core cooling and CS systems utilize the RWST as a water source. Upon the receipt of a RWST lo-2 level, both automatic and manual actions are performed to align the emergency core cooling system (ECCS) water source from the RWST to the containment sump. Upon a RWST lo-3 level, the plant licensing basis assumes that the CS system is manually aligned from the RWST to the containment sump by opening CS009A and CS009B valves and isolating the RWST by shutting the CS001B valve. The license identified that during the performance of the surveillance, if the CS009A/B valves failed to shut (as on June 17, 2010, or from an assumed license basis active single failure) and if a safety injection had occurred, that upon the receipt of a RWST lo-2 level signal, a portion of the RWST would drain back into the containment sump via the open CS009A/B valve. Until the ECCS swap over was completed, an unanalyzed amount of RWST borated water would have drained into the containment sump and would not have been available for injection and assumed accident boration. This condition also applied to Unit 1. The licensee determined that the root cause of this condition stemmed from inadequate reviews since the plant was originally licensed and inadequate procedures created and implemented in 1988. Upon licensing, additional revisions to the surveillance procedure did not identify the unanalyzed condition. The inspectors reviewed this LER and determined that it was completed in accordance with NRC regulations. The licensees review determined that the station did not have an adequate procedure for performing this surveillance activity and implemented changes to prevent recurrence. The inspectors identified that this issue was a performance deficiency that had been identified by the licensee and entered into the stations CAP. The enforcement aspects of this finding are discussed in Section 4OA7 of this report. This LER is closed. This finding was determined to be of very low safety significance based on an estimated core damage probability of 9.6 E-8.",['50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B)']

Due to this transient, the 'A' Control Room Air Conditioning Unit (CRAC 'A') tripped and had to be manually restarted. CRAC 'A' was not running for approximately two minutes. During this timeframe CRAC 'B' was tagged out of service. This was evaluated and determined to not be a loss of safety function. Emergency Class: NON EMERGENCY",['50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A)']
"UNPLANNED SYSTEMS ACTUATIONS WHILE PERFORMING A SURVEILLANCE TEST Unit 1 was performing a planned refueling outage surveillance test, FNP-1-STP-40.0, 'Safety Injection with Loss of Off-Site Power LOSP.' The systems were being returned to normal following the actuation portion of the test. When the B1F Sequencer Test Trip Override Switch was taken to the 'ON' position, the 1-2A Diesel Generator output breaker opened, which caused a loss of power to the 'A' Train 4 kV busses. Prior to the event, the 1-2A Diesel Generator was running at normal speed and voltage carrying the 'A' Train 4kV busses. When the diesel generator output breaker opened, it then reclosed upon receipt of the LOSP signal causing the LOSP sequencer loads to automatically start. This included the 1C Component Cooling Water Pump, the 1A High Head Safety Injection Pump (discharge isolation was closed prior to the event), and the 1A and 1B SW pumps. Therefore, during the test, the system actuated in a way that was not part of the planned surveillance testing. The 1A RHR pump was in shutdown cooling mode at the time of the event and was load shed. RHR was restarted manually by the operating crew approximately 1 minute later (no auto start signal present due to a loss of site power - LOSP signal without a safety injection signal present). The investigation revealed that a step in the procedure sequence was not performed during the restoration portion of the test. The operator did not parallel the diesel with off-site power prior to operating the B1F Sequencer Test Trip Override Switch which opened the diesel output breaker without off-site power aligned to the 'A' Train 4kV busses. The 1-2A Diesel Generator was subsequently paralleled to the grid and properly shutdown per the test procedure restoration. Emergency Class: NON EMERGENCY",['50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A)']
"The Drywell Spray Function is not currently in the Peach Bottom Technical Specifications. During a Small Steam Line Break (SSLB) event, drywell sprays are required in order for the containment temperature to remain below 340 deg. F. Since the drywell sprays are required to mitigate the SSLB, based on Criterion 3, the drywell spray function is required in the Technical Specifications. Peach Bottom's requirements for the RHR drywell spray function are contained in Section 3.12 of the Technical Requirements Manual (TRM). Those requirements were removed from Peach Bottom's Technical Specifications at the time of conversion to improved standard technical specifications (ITS) in January 1996. The following justification was provided for removal from tech specs: ""The drywell spray is not credited in any DBA (i.e., it is not needed to function to mitigate the consequence of any design basis accidents) and it is a secondary action in the emergency procedures. Therefore, drywell spray is not risk significant and can be relocated outside of Technical Specifications. This change is consistent with NUREG-1433."" At the time of removal, drywell spray was not needed to mitigate a Recirc Suction Line Break, which was considered the bounding accident, and is currently the only LOCA described as a DBA in the UFSAR. Although evaluated as not being required to mitigate a DBA, drywell sprays were, and still are, the primary success path for mitigating a steam line break (in the drywell). At the time of the ITS conversion, Peach Bottom did not have an SSLB analysis. An SSLB analysis was performed for Peach Bottom under GE-NE-0000-011-4483 in 2003. This analysis states that ""steam line breaks are the most limiting events for drywell temperature response"", and ""these analyses, with primary focus on the drywell temperature response, took credit for containment sprays and structural heat sinks in the drywell and wetwell airspace."" The Peach Bottom-specific analyses confirm that drywell sprays are relied upon to limit the peak drywell temperature for an SSLB. NEDO-31466 Supplement 1, Technical Specification screening Criteria application and Risk Assessment, dated February 1996 (the analysis that provides the basis for what is in and not in TS) concluded (on page 5-53) that: ""Thus, the drywell spray mode of RHR is not considered as part of the primary success path for mitigation of postulated design basis accident."" This statement supported the drywell spray function removal from Tech Specs when ITS was implemented. However, there is a note on page 5-53 which states: Note: Some Mark 1 containments do take credit for containment spray for long term containment response to small break LOCAs to ensure that the peak drywell temperature remains below its design value. This note provided an exception to the basic argument that DW spray is not required to be in TS. However, if DW spray is credited for SSLBs, NEDO-31466 Supplement 1 indicates that Drywell Spray should not have been removed from the Technical Specifications. As stated previously, Peach Bottom did not have an analysis for the SSLB when ITS was implemented. When the GE analysis was performed in 2003, an opportunity to identify that drywell sprays should be in Technical Specification presented itself. However, since the DBA-LOCA (Recirc Line Break) was still the bounding radiological accident and NEDO-31466 Supplement 1 was not readily known in 2003, no action was taken to move DW Spray back into the TS at that time. Another opportunity for identification that the drywell spray function should be in the Technical Specifications occurred in 2003 during PORC review of an evaluation. In 1996, when the Drywell Spray Technical Specification was removed from the Tech Specs and placed in the TRM, the action statement required a shutdown. As part of a regulatory assurance initiative, TRM actions statements that required Unit shutdown were reviewed for removal. As part of this initiative, the action statement for drywell spray inoperability was changed. TRMS 3.12, RHR Drywell Spray, Condition C was revised to require implementation of the Corrective Action Program (CAP) and receive management approval for exiting the condition instead of entering Mode 3 in 12 hours and Mode 4 in 36 hours in the event that one RHR drywell spray subsystem is inoperable for 7 days or if both subsystems are inoperable for 8 hours. This TRM change occurred in 2003 following PORC approval the Evaluation. Engineering Assessment of Operability: Since Peach Bottom is not currently in an Action Statement for TRM 3.12, both loops of drywell spray are considered operable (for both Unit 2 and Unit 3). Reportability Assessment: Regulatory Assurance, Operations, and Engineering discussed this issue for reportability. While on-shift Operations personnel will need to make the determination, the discussion resulted in the following recommendation: This event would not be considered as a prompt NRC notification in accordance with reporting requirements. Preliminary review of the TRM 3.12 entries for the previous 3 years have not identified any instances when the completion time was not met for an inoperable drywell spray sub-system. However, formal review is required and is requested in the Recommended Action section.",[]
"At 1030 EDT Dresden station completed notification to the NRC Reactor Plant Event Notification Worksheet. The notification was assigned event number 48080. The notification was for the Invalid group 5 Isolation Due to Failed Test Switch During Surveillance. The notification read as follows: ""At 0236 CDT on Tuesday, July 10 2012, the Dresden Nuclear Power Station (DNPS) U3 Isolation Condenser System automatically isolated due to a inadvertent partial Group 5 Primary Containment Isolation System (PCIS) isolation, causing the inboard isolation valves to close. The PCIS isolation was caused during the performance of DIS 1300-07, U3 Isolation Condenser Steam/Condensate Line High Flow Calibration due to a failed test switch. The test switch failed to bypass the PCIS signal generated during the surveillance. All valves responded as expected due to this condition. The isolation condenser was declared inoperable and Technical Specification 3.5.3, Condition A was entered. HPCI was verified to be operable to satisfy the requirements of TS 3.5.3, Condition A.2. This condition is reportable due to a condition occurring that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function needed for residual heat removal.",['50.72(b)(3)(v)(B)']
"At 12:00 on July 13, 2012 it was determined, during a conference call with the Exelon siren vendor, that Oyster Creek emergency planning zone (EPZ) sirens may be unreliable. The unreliability is being caused by an intermittent signal on the frequency used to activate the sirens. A 4-hour NRC report was made on 7/13/12 at 1420 based on the following: Exelon contacted the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for troubleshooting and reporting purposes, as well as the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management (NJ OEM) and the Ocean County Office of Emergency Management to institute compensatory actions. Exelon will notify the NRC Operations Center upon full-restoration of the Oyster Creek EPZ siren system. The interfering signal appears to be resulting from an atmospheric phenomenon that has resulted in the transmission of a radio signal, at the same frequency as the siren control frequency, from the New York City area. This is based on information from the FCC.","['50.72(b)(2)(xi)', '50.72(b)(3)(xiii)']"

The MCR was notified by IT (T. Barnett) that ERDS was unavailable and that the issue was believed to be an equipment problem at the NRC end. This was supported by the fact that the other Exelon Midwest ROG sites were experiencing similar issues. IT later called to confirm that the issue had been resolved and that the problem had been positively identified as an NRC equipment issue. Total time between the initial notification of unavailability and the call confirming that ERDS communication had been reestablished was approximately 33 minutes.,['50.72(b)(3)(xiii)']

"IR 1414490 describes an event at LaSalle in which secondary containment integrity was adversely impacted. Corporate Licensing was contacted by LaSalle Operations to perform a peer check for potential reportability to the NRC. LS-AA-1110, Revision 17, SAF 1.8 was reviewed as part of that effort. SAF 1.8 contains an error with respect to when a loss of secondary containment is considered reportable. Specifically, SAF 1.8 includes a condition that vacuum must be less than allowed by the plant's Technical Specifications in order for a loss of secondary containment to be reportable. This condition was added in response to ATI 1212744 based upon a violation documented in an NRC inspection report for LaSalle (i.e., Inspection Report 2011002, dated 5/11/11). The violation concerned a failure to report to the NRC an event in which secondary containment could not have fulfilled its safety function. The NRC stated that because secondary containment had been declared inoperable that it could not based on the Tech Spec definition of Operable/Operability perform its safety function, and as such should have been reported to the NRC. However, Revision 17 of LS-AA-1110 incorrectly translated the NRC's basis for the violation by including the condition that vacuum must be less than allowed by the plant's Technical Specifications in order for a loss of secondary containment to be reportable. The reason the event was reportable was because secondary containment was declared inoperable due to the failure to maintain the required vacuum. Other unplanned events in which secondary containment is declared inoperable but for which vacuum is satisfactory would be screened as not reportable per the current guidance in SAF 1.8. This is contrary to the NRC requirements and could result in future NRC violations for failing to make required NRC notifications. LS-AA-1110 SAF 1.8 should be revised to read as follows: ""Loss of secondary containment is considered reportable. A breach of secondary containment (which includes simultaneous opening of two interlock (or airlock) doors) is considered reportable if the following conditions are met: 1) secondary containment is required in the current mode or other specified condition; 2) secondary containment is declared inoperable in accordance with the plant's Technical Specifications; and 3) the reason(s) for inoperability is (are) not part of a planned evolution.""",['50.72(b)(3)(v)(C)']

"Limerick's load sequencing of safety related loads during a design basis loss of coolant accident with offsite power available intentionally sheds all 480v loads on the LOCA affected unit when reactor level reaches Level 1 and low pressure ECCS pumps start. MOVs that are already stroking closed from previous isolation signals (like high DW pressure or reactor level 2) will stop during the load shed. If the MOV stops in the 'dead zone' where the valve indicates closed, those MOVs that use LS-8 as an isolation permissive will not resume isolation when 480v power is restored. LS-8 provides a permissive for automatic isolation that ensures that the valve gets approximately 90% or further closed. A closed contactor seal in (42C/ 'a' switch) ensures that the valve continues fully closed when LS-8 opens. After the torque switch trip, the seal in contact opens to remove the auto isolation signal (anti-hammering circuit). Removal of the isolation signal is required for MOVs with non-locking gear sets since the torque switch will reclose, reinitiating the valve closure over and over if LS-8 did not remove the signal. IR1402693 identified three CAC isolation valve on each unit that would have power interrupted in the dead zone. The subject CAC isolation valves in the original IR were temporarily resolved on Unit 1 by short stroking the valves to close within 3 seconds.

During the final clear of C/O 104822 for the U2 RWCU sample valves, the EO entered the U2 RWCU heat exchanger room in order to execute a step of the clearance. During the execution of the step in the room, DPI 1-5740-22, RB TO ATMOS DP indicated less than -0.1"" H20 and 912-5 C-1 RX BLDG 1 LOW DP and 912-5 C-4 RX BLD 2 LOW DP alarms were received. Reactor building went >0"" dP for two minutes until the door was closed. Technical Specification 3.6.4.1 Condition A and QGA 300 were entered. Two minutes later, Reactor Building DP was restored to >-0.10"" H20. Exited T.S. 3.6.4.1 Condition A. No emergency existed and exited QGA 300. 

Immediate actions taken: Entered/exited T.S. 3.6.4.1 Condition A. 

Recommended Actions: System Manager to investigate and determine the necessary system control improvements to prevent unnecessary T.S. entries during normal operations. 

What activities, processes, or procedures were involved? Final clear of CO 104822, while entering RWCU HX room. 

Why did the condition happen? Low Reactor Building to atmosphere DP during execution of a clearance order. 

What are the consequences? Entry into T.S. 3.6.4.1 Condition A and QGA 300. 

Repeat or similar condition? Yes - refer to recent IRs including IRs 1412296, 1416123, 1416156, 1417996. 

Operable Basis: T.S. 3.6.4.1. Cond A Secondary Containment was entered and exited as required. Secondary Containment vacuum has been verified to be greater than or equal to 0.10 inch of vacuum water gauge. Secondary Containment has been restored to Operable status. 

Reportable Basis: Reference SAF 1.8 as needed.

Functional Basis: The Reactor Building ventilation system is functional but degraded. RB dP has been restored, but the RWCU/RB dP control systems should be capable of maintaining normal dP during RWCU room entries. Because it is slow to respond, this leads to unnecessary T.S. entries.

Department review performed by: JEREMY BRIES 10/09/2012 14:35:04 CDT 
Evaluation Comments:

Condition/Problem Statement: During the final clear of clearance order (C/O) 104822 for the U2 Reactor Water Clean Up (RWCU) sample valves, the Operator entered the U2 RWCU heat exchanger room in order to execute a step of the clearance. During the execution of the step in the room, DPI 1-5740-22, RB TO ATMOS DP indicated less than -0.1"" w.c. and 912-5 C-1 RX BLDG 1 LOW DP and 912-5 C-4 RX BLDG 2 LOW DP alarms were received. Reactor Building to Atmosphere DP was > 0"" for two minutes until the door was closed. Technical Specification 3.6.4.1 Condition A and QGA 300 were entered. Two minutes later, Reactor Building DP was restored to < -0.10"" w.c. TS 3.6.4.1 Condition A was exited. No emergency existed and QGA 300 was exited.

Statement of Cause: The two alarms received in the Main Control Room were caused by a loss of Reactor Building DP and U2 Area DP. The area DP was lost when the door to the RWCU room was opened. This is an expected alarm as the Area DP is a comparison of the pressure in the RWCU vs. the pressure on the refuel floor. Opening the door causes the DP between those two areas to become zero. The loss of Building DP was caused by two air leaks in the pneumatic control instrumentation for the U2 Area DP (see IR 1421995). The air leaks degraded the signal air to the U2 Area DP control dampers. Therefore, these area DP dampers were in an almost closed position resulting in a high initial DP condition between the RWCU room and refuel floor. When the RWCU room doors were opened, DP dramatically dropped (-0.45"" to 0.0"") and all area DP dampers repositioned (including exhaust air dampers from the refueling floor). This significantly changed the pressure on the refueling floor and therefore the Building DP as measured from the atmosphere to the refuel floor. IR 1421995 identified two air leaks in the U2 Reactor Building Ventilation Control Panel 2252-24x: one at P/E transducer P/E 2-5741-191 and the other at a rubber tube connection on the inlet of DPC 2-5703-3. Both of these instruments are associated with the Unit 2 Reactor Building Ventilation Area DP control. The goal of the Area DP control is to maintain the most contaminated rooms inside the reactor building at a more negative pressure than general areas. This allows the air to flow from areas of lesser contamination to areas of greater contamination, thus controlling the spread of contamination in the reactor building. 

Extent of Condition: Any additional leaks within the Reactor Building Area DP control system will be identified as troubleshooting continues under WO 1578805. Any additional failure information will be evaluated under the associated Failure Classification Form because this issue was identified as a Maintenance Rule Functional Failure under function Z7504-03 (see AT 1418466-02 for more information). 

Evaluation of any SOC Comments: SOC/MRC asked the question of why the RB DP was lost when the U2 RWCU Room door was opened and the room was entered. This explanation can be found in the Statement of Cause section of this evaluation. 

Actions Completed/Created:

AT 1412296-02 due 10/29/12 to create a PHC presentation for actions to deal with the Reactor Building DP control issues. 

AT 1418466-02 due 11/2/12 to perform a failure classification form (FCF) for the MRFF on the RB Ventilation MR function for loss of Bldg DP. 

WO 1578805 was generated out of IR 1418466 to troubleshoot the Unit 2 RB Area DP control. This WO was originally scheduled for May 2013. Following the initiation of IR 1421955 this WO was added to the POD as part of the RB DP control item.

The only air leak that can be repaired under WO 1578805 is the rubber tubing connection for DPC 2-5703-3. The other air leak inside P/E 2-5741-191 can't be repaired. The only way to fix the leak is to replace the P/E transducer. This P/E transducer can't be replaced because it is obsolete and a replacement P/E transducer can't be procured. This air leak will need to be repaired by completing a TMOD to cut and cap the air lines to P/E transducer 2-5741-191. This TMOD will cause the loss of Unit 2 Area DP indication in the Main Control Room. A permanent modification will need to follow the TMOD to either eliminate the MCR indication or replace the old obsolete area DP control instruments with electronic or digital controls. These actions will be part of the action plan tracked by AT 1412296-02.

The notification read as follows: ""OFFSITE NOTIFICATION MADE DUE TO POTENTIAL INADVERTENT RELEASE OF TRITIUM The notification is being made due to the fact that Exelon Nuclear has informed the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) of the discovery of a hole in the A Waste Sample Tank resulting in a potential inadvertent release of tritium at Dresden Station. Any release is currently contained within the plant's restricted area. The notifications to IEMA and IEPA were made at 1340 hours CDT on October 20, 2012. The tank was out of service and had been emptied for internal inspection. Therefore at the time of discovery, there was no active leak. The IEPA/ IEMA regulations require notification when newly occurring, event-related unpermitted releases of radionuclides are identified. A release has not been confirmed but is suspected. A review of the historical groundwater monitoring well data trends and trending analysis from wells in proximity to the tank indicates no impact on groundwater. Further investigation of the groundwater in the area of the tank is ongoing to determine if an actual release has occurred. The potential leak was not released to an unrestricted area; therefore there is no anticipated adverse impact to the health and safety of the public.

"During a review investigating the impact of the proposed EPU power uprate upon pool hydrodynamic loads it was discovered that Design Analysis 3C7-0781-001 ""Investigation of Containment Response to Subcooled Inventory Blowdown Effect"" (a 1983 vintage calculation) did not properly address the effect of subcooling. This issue is applicable to LaSalle Units 1 and 2. Historical Background Following the DBA LOCA (double guillotine break of a reactor recirculation suction line), the drywell becomes pressurized. This causes non-condensable gas & steam to flow into the suppression pool through 98 downcomer vent lines. This in turn results in a phenomenon where a portion of water in the suppression pool swells up and imposes drag and impact loads on items located in the pool swell zone. The phenomenon is referred to as pool swell. The drag and impact loads associated with the pool swell phenomenon were determined in Design Analysis 3C7-1075-001 (first issued in 1975). This Design Analysis will be referred to as calc ""1075"". These loads were used as input to subsequent analyses that demonstrated the adequacy of affected piping and structural items for the pool swell loads. After completion of calc ""1075"" it was learned that input upon which calc ""1075"" was based was not conservative. The input was from analysis of the DBA-LOCA event that used saturated water, instead of subcooled water. Subsequent investigations found the use of subcooled break effluent results in a higher mass release rate which affects the drywell pressure response and the pool swell loads. Calc ""0781"" was generated to address sub-cooling and to demonstrate that the pool swell loads determined in calc ""1075"" remain bounding. As explained in the summary of calc ""0781"": ""The LaSalle design basis pool swell loads were calculated for the recirculation pump suction line break mass/energy release rates which did not include the ""subcooled inventory effect"". When the ""subcooled inventory effect"" is included the pool swell loads increase. In order to avoid costly design reassessment and possible design modifications, the mass/energy release rate, customarily provided by GE which calculates it with their own conservative assumptions, was recalculated with a less conservative model..The RELAP4/MOD5 generated mass/energy release rates were used to . determine the pool swell water velocity vs pool swell height. The pool swell water velocity profile was then compared to the design water slug velocity profile. The comparison confirmed that the design water slug velocity profile bounds the new calculated water slug velocity profile."" Non-Conforming Condition Investigations performed for EPU determined that that calc ""0781"" did not appropriately address subcooling. Specifically: calc ""0781"" used saturated water in the annulus area of the RPV (the area between the core shroud and the RPV wall, the area where the jet pumps are located). Since the DBA-LOCA is a double guillotine break of a reactor recirculation suction line and the reactor recirculation suction lines draw from the annulus area, the water in the annulus area of the RPV should be subcooled, not saturated. The recent discovery that calc ""0781"" did not appropriately address subcooling brings into question whether the loads determined in calc ""1075"" remain bounding. Should the loads determined in calc ""1075"" not be bounding, then items subject to pool swell loads may be subjected to higher loads than currently considered in design analyses. Basis for Reasonable Assurance of Continued Operability Based upon the following and the use of engineering judgment the following review concludes that the piping and structural items located in the suppression chamber that are affected by the pool swell phenomena will remain adequate. The design configuration avoids horizontal pipe runs in the pool swell zone whenever possible. (Ref: S&L Report SL-3876, Sections 3.1.3, 3.9.1.3, and 3.9.4). Affected Wetwell piping, their associated support system, and other items were modified during original plant construction (from their initial design) to increase their load capacity to sustain pool swell loads and/or minimize pool swell loads (Ref: S&L Report SL-3876, Section 3.6.4). To obtain an initial assessment of the possible impact of this discovery, an evaluation was performed by General Electric Hitachi (GEH) to determine the pool swell velocity versus pool height using a best-estimate model that addressed subcooling. The drag and impact loads associated with the pool swell phenomena are dependent upon the velocity of the pool swell. A comparison of pool swell velocity profile determined in the GEH evaluation and that used in calc ""0781"" the analysis of record (AOR), shows that the velocity profile in the AOR envelopes the velocity profile in the GEH evaluation except for swell heights less than approx 7 ft. In addition, where the GEH velocities exceed the velocities determined in the AOR; the amount is not significant. This GEH evaluation was performed for operability and did not consider several of the inputs/assumptions/methodology required for a design analysis. For example, the GEH evaluation did not consider reduced feedwater temperature (""Final Feedwater Temperature Reduction""). The GEH evaluation does not credit the lower downcomer bracing that is located just below the pool surface. As an initial check of existing margins, a study performed for the Mark II Pool Swell Subcommittee had previously assessed the effect of such bracing upon the dynamics of the pool swell phenomena. The study shows that bracing at or near the pool surface provides resistance that reduces the swell velocity by 15% to 17%. If the GEH review is extended to include evaluation of the effects of the installed LaSalle bracing; the velocity profile would be reduced and the velocity profile indicates that the AOR would be expected to envelope the reduced GEH velocity profile. Therefore, the pool swell loads considered in the AOR have been initially reviewed and seen to envelope those associated with the adjusted (reduced) GEH velocity profile. In addition: A preliminary assessment of representative items affected by the pool swell phenomena shows that they have margin to accommodate higher pool swell velocities. Current guidance for potential load increases in piping and supports provide a basis for the conclusion that the existing conditions are acceptable as non-conforming conditions. In particular: As identified in OP-AA-108-115 ""Operability Evaluations"", Section 4.5.8 regarding non-conforming piping and supports, the allowables in Appendix F of the ASME B&PV Code, Section III should be used to for determining operability. These allowables are significantly higher than those currently used in the design analysis. OP-AA-108-115 identifies that the Appendix F allowables are to be used until the Current Licensing Basis (CLB) criteria can be satisfied.",[]

"LaSalle has received the NRC Special Inspection Team (SIT) report for the inspection activities conducted the week of April 22, 2013 related to the 4/17/13 Dual Unit LOOP and associated automatic scrams on Unit 1 and Unit 2. The inspectors identified a finding of very low safety significance with an associated Severity Level IV non-cited violation of the NRC's reporting requirements. The licensee failed to make a required 8-hour non-emergency notification call to the NRC Operations Center after discovery of a condition that could have prevented fulfillment of the safety function of the low pressure core spray (LPCS) system. The licensee entered this issue into its corrective action program (CAP) for evaluation and made an appropriate notification call to the NRC Operations Center. This finding was of more than minor significance because the NRC relies on licensees to identify and report conditions or events meeting the criteria specified in the Technical Specifications and the regulations in order to perform its regulatory function. Because this issue affected the NRC's ability to perform its regulatory function, the inspectors evaluated it using the traditional enforcement process and assessed the significance of the underlying issue using the Significance Determination Process (SDP). The underlying technical issue (i.e., an inoperable LPCS system) was determined to be of very low safety significance using the SDP. Consistent with the guidance in Section 6.9, Paragraph d.9, of the NRC Enforcement Policy, the violation associated with this finding was determined to be a Severity Level IV Violation. This finding affected the cross-cutting area of problem identification and resolution. Specifically, the licensee did not implement and institutionalize operating experience from a similar event reported at another licensee's facility while evaluating the reportability of the inoperable single train safety system. The inspectors reviewed the preliminary assessment and the design basis of the switchyard as described in the UFSAR. The inspectors noted that Section 8.2.3.2, ""Adequacy of Offsite Power,"" of the UFSAR stated, in part, that: ""The switchyard arrangement is such that offsite power to both units cannot be lost due to any single failure."" Additionally, UFSAR Section 8.1.2.5, ""Unit Non-Class 1E DC System,"" stated, in part, that: ""The design of the protective relay circuits for the 345-kV oil circuit breakers and the 345-kV transmission lines is such that the loss of either battery or the loss of both batteries and associated feeder cables will not cause the loss of offsite power sources."" Whether the series of events in the LaSalle switchyards that led to the dual-unit LOOP stemmed from a single failure or more than one failure, and whether the design of the switchyards meets regulatory requirements remain open questions.

"IR# 1635618, CDBI: INADEQUATE PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE OF A DESIGN ASSUMPTION, was created on 3/19/2014 to document a condition where design assumptions in a calculation did not align with procedural direction / guidance. This issue identified that the Engineering calculation PM-620 utilizes an RHR flow rate of 9050 gpm (assuming one RHR pump in service) to the vessel in determining maximum opening differential pressure across the MO-2(3)-10-039A(B) valves. The calculation assumes that opening the MO-39A(B) valve (to place torus cooling in service) occurs with the pump off or with at least 9050 gpm being pumped to reduce pressure seen by the MOV. The scenario of interest is the small break LOCA without reaching -160"" RWL. The timeline is as follows: -Small break LOCA resulting in 2# in the drywell. -HPCI maintains level above -160"". -OPS places torus cooling in service. -Rx continues to depressurize to 450 #. -RHR pumps start and system re-aligns for LPCI upon reaching 450# (2# drywell already received). -5 minute timer for MO-2(3)-10-154A(B) times out. -Rx pressure is below 450# but still above RHR shut off head. -OPS attempts to place torus cooling in service iaw AO 10.8-2(3) Section 4.1. Not all Operations procedures address ensuring that an RHR pump is secured prior to opening MO-39A(B). Since RHR pumps could be running without injection and MO-2(3)-10-039A(B) is not designed to open against this dp (per calculation), it does not open when the switch is taken to open. When the Operations SRO performed a review of IR# 1635618, the SRO did not identify any non-conforming condition while considering current operability of the U2 and U3 MO-39A(B) for current plant conditions and did not determine that any of the 4 MO-39s were inoperable. It was reviewed only from the viewpoint that this was a procedural issue in relationship to the calculation and not reflective of a component inoperability. The potential for an impact post accident was not taken into account. This operability review was independently reviewed by a second SRO. Operations also entered into the IR review that Operations personnel are trained during simulator training that the MO-39 valves are not to be operated while an RHR pump is in service due to the DP concerns. In addition, actions to revise the procedures identified as deficient were not immediately revised or TCd. This was completed on 3/20/2014. The NRC's concern is that when OPS is directed to open MO-2(3)-10-039A(B) to place torus cooling in service IAW AO 10.8-2(3) (or other procedures that direct opening MO-2(3)-10-039A(B)) the valve would not open since it is not designed to open against pump shutoff (or min flow) head. NRC contention is since the valve may not open on demand it should be considered inoperable. (The valve must be capable of opening under all accidents it is credited for). This condition, if proved that the valves would not meet the requirements to open under all credited accidents, would be reportable as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a Safety Function, due to both subsystems of Torus Cooling, Torus Sprays and Drywell Sprays being affected for both U2 and U3. Based on actions taken by Operations to address the concern with MO-2(3)-10-039A(B), this condition has been addressed with respect to current operability.

Abstract:
At approximately 0715 (CDT) on 7/1/2014, during the daily morning test, Braidwood Generating Station experienced Offsite Alert and Notification System (ANS) failure of sirens BD10 and BD13 due to a loss of power to the sirens. Loss of power to the sirens was due to the adverse weather conditions experienced on the evening of 6/30/2014. Siren BD10 provides coverage for 20% of Braidwood's Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) population and siren BD13 provides coverage for 14.1% of the Braidwood EPZ population. The cause of the event was a power outage due to adverse weather conditions. There were no consequences to the operating units.

Lessons Learned Summary:
Weather or Environmental Condition - Weather Tested and Restored to Service Actions to Prevent Recurrence not Needed

Event Summary:
The failure of the sirens resulted in the loss of the capability to alert a large segment of the population in the EPZ (34%) for more than 1 hour. Per NEI 13-01, Rev 0, a large segment of the population in the EPZ should be taken to mean approximately 25% of the total EPZ population. Immediate actions taken included placing a portable generator online to restore siren BD10 at 1015 CDT on 7/1/2014. ComEd is currently in the area attempting to restore normal power. Proposed long term corrective actions including an upgrade to the sirens to contain a battery backup are being evaluated. The licensee has notified the NRC Resident Inspector. The county emergency managers (for Will County - for siren BD10 and Grundy County - for siren BD13) are aware of the siren outage and the requirements to initiate mobile route alerting (FEMA approved backup) if required.

Cause Summary:
The cause of the loss of power to the sirens was adverse weather conditions.

Corrective Action Summary:
Temporary power was provided to siren BD10 at 10:15 on 7/1/14. The power was restored to siren BD10 on 7/1/14 at 1120. The power was restored to siren BD13 on 7/2/14 at 1145.

""The High Pressure Core Spray (HPCS) system at River Bend Station includes a test return line to the Condensate Storage Tank (CST). The test return line is isolated by two motor operated valves (MOVs) with both having a safety function to close on an ECCS Emergency Core Cooling System] initiation signal to ensure that injection flow is directed to the reactor vessel. While the HPCS pump is normally aligned to the CST, the credited source of water for the pump is the suppression pool. Accordingly, the pump suction is realigned to the suppression pool on low level in the CST or when suppression pool level rises to a certain point. Station personnel identified leakage past the test return valves to the CST. In evaluating this condition, engineering personnel noted that the observed leakage past the two MOVs might be sufficient to deplete suppression pool inventory such that it would not be capable of performing its specified function for the duration of the 30 day mission time. The issue of concern is that once HPCS is aligned to the suppression pool post-LOCA, pool inventory would be lost to the CST through the leaking test return valves. ""Based on that concern, the HPCS pump suction valve from the suppression pool was disabled in the closed position to preserve pool inventory. This action caused the HPCS system to be declared inoperable at 2142 CDT]. This action results in a 14 day shutdown LCO and is reportable to the NRC. ""The HPCS pump remains available with its suction aligned to the CST. Assuming normal makeup water supplies are available, the HPCS system can be realigned to the suppression pool if necessary.

"As documented in IR 1695675, a 10 dpm leak was observed on ESW piping on an elbow between HV-2-33-502 and CHK-2-33-513. A graduated cylinder was used to measure the leak rate and it determined to be 3 ml/minute. Engineering evaluated the location of the piping flaw and determined that Code Case N-513-3 was not applicable since the flaw existed on an elbow.

"Brief Description: UNANALYZED DC CIRCUIT FROM THE BATTERY AND BATTERY CHARGER AMMETER GOING TO THE CONTROL ROOM FOR A FIRE IN UNIT 1 CABLE SPREADING ROOM (CSR) WHICH COULD ALSO CAUSE A SECONDARY FIRE IN THE UNIT 2 CSR.

Detailed Description: AS A RESULT OF RECENT INDUSTRY OPERATING EXPERIENCE (OE 305419, EN 49411) AT PALO VERDE REGARDING THE IMPACT OF UNFUSED DIRECT CURRENT (DC) AMMETER CIRCUITS IN THE CONTROL ROOM AND AS DISCUSSED IN CR-2013-008020, CALVERT CLIFFS PERFORMED A REVIEW OF AMMETER CIRCUITRY. THE SPECIFIC FUSE ISSUE AT PALO VERDE WITH SHORTING ACROSS THE DC BUS DOES NOT OCCUR FOR CALVERT. HOWEVER, THERE IS AN UNANALYZED CONDITION IN WHICH THE UNFUSED LENGTH OF CABLE GOING FROM THE DC BUS TO THE CONTROL FROM U2 CABLE SPREADING ROOM GOES THROUGH THE UNIT 1 CABLE SPREADING ROOM ON ITS WAY TO THE CONTROL ROOM. THE SAME EXISTS FOR THE CABLE FOR THE CHARGERS. THE REVERSE IS NOT TRUE FOR THE UNIT 1 CABLE SPREADING ROOM (EXTENT OF CONDITION REVIEWED AND NOT IMPACTED). THE COMPENSATORY ACTION WILL NEED TO BE HOURLY FIRE WATCH FOR THE U1 AND U2 CABLE SPREADING ROOM UNTIL A PERMANENT ACTION IS TAKEN TO CORRECT THE ISSUE. THE PERMANENT ACTION APPEARS TO BE A PLANT MODIFICATION TO ADD A FUSE TO THESE CABLES (6 CIRCUITS). WE HAVE ALREADY REACHED OUT TO OBTAIN ESTIMATES TO COMPLETE THIS ENGINEERING AND EVALUATING OTHER POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, DAVIS BESSE, BROWNS FERRY, VC SUMMER, CALLOWAY, COMANCHE PEAK, AND PALO VERDE HAVE REPORTED AND ARE TAKING SIMILAR COMPENSATORY ACTIONS. THE WIRING DESIGN FOR THE AMMETERS CONTAINS A SHUNT IN THE CURRENT FLOW FROM EACH DC BATTERY OR CHARGER. THE AMMETER WIRING ATTACHED TO THE SHUNT DOES NOT CONTAIN FUSES. IT IS POSTULATED THAT A FIRE COULD CAUSE ONE OF THE AMMETER WIRES TO HOT SHORT TO GROUND. CONCURRENTLY, THE FIRE CAUSES ANOTHER DC WIRE FROM THE OPPOSITE POLARITY ON THE SAME BATTERY TO ALSO SHORT TO GROUND. THIS WOULD CAUSE A GROUND LOOP THROUGH THE UNFUSED AMMETER CABLE. THE POTENTIAL EXISTS THAT THE CABLE COULD HEAT-UP CAUSING A SECONDARY FIRE IN THE AMMETER RACEWAY. THE SECONDARY FIRE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT SAFE SHUTDOWN EQUIPMENT IN THE UNIT 2 CABLE SPREADING ROOM AND POTENTIALLY CAUSE THE LOSS OF THE ABILITY TO SAFELY SHUTDOWN PER THE EXISTING ANALYSIS FOR THE UNIT 1 CABLE SPREADING ROOM FIRE.

"Brief Description: REVIEW OF INDUSTRY OE HAS IDENTIFIED NMP UNIT 1 CONFIGURATION SIMILAR TO THAT DESCRIBED IN OE 305419 Detailed Description: OE305419 (ATTACHED TO THIS CR), IDENTIFIES A POSTULATED FIRE INDUCED CIRCUIT FAILURE INVOLVING UN-FUSED DC AMMETER CIRCUITS LEADING TO A POTENTIAL NON-COMPLIANCE TO AN APPENDIX R REQUIREMENTS. A REVIEW OF DC AMMETER CIRCUITS FOR THE CLASS 1E BATTERIES HAS CONCLUDED THAT SIMILAR CONFIGURATION EXISTS AT NMP UNIT 1. IN ADDITION, A PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF THE BATTERY CHARGER CIRCUITS SHOWS THAT THEY HAVE A SIMILAR CONFIGURATION TO THE BATTERY AMMETERS AND MAY ALSO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE ISSUE DESCRIBED. THE FOLLOWING EXCERPT FROM THE OE DESCRIBES THE POTENTIAL APPENDIX R IMPACT: ""THE WIRING DESIGN FOR THE AMMETERS CONTAINS A SHUNT IN THE CURRENT FLOW FROM EACH DIRECT CURRENT (DC) BATTERY OR CHARGER. BOLTED ON THE SHUNT BAR ARE TWO IEEE 383 QUALIFIED LEADS TO A CURRENT METER IN THE MAIN CONTROL ROOM (MCR). THE SMALL DIFFERENCE IN VOLTAGE BETWEEN THE TWO TAPS ON THE SHUNT IS ENOUGH TO DEFLECT THE CURRENT GAUGE IN THE MCR WHEN CURRENT FLOWS FROM THE BATTERY OR CHARGER THROUGH THE SHUNT. THE AMMETER WIRING ATTACHED TO THE SHUNT (POSITIVE SIDE OF THE BATTERY) DOES NOT HAVE FUSES. IT IS POSTULATED THAT A FIRE COULD CAUSE ONE OF THESE AMMETER WIRES TO SHORT TO GROUND AT THE SAME TIME THE FIRE CAUSES ANOTHER DC WIRE FROM THE OPPOSITE POLARITY (NEGATIVE SIDE) ON THE SAME BATTERY ALSO SHORT TO GROUND. THIS WOULD CAUSE A GROUND LOOP THROUGH THE UN-FUSED AMMETER CABLE. WITH ENOUGH CURRENT GOING THROUGH THE CABLE, THE POTENTIAL EXISTS THAT THE CABLE COULD SELF HEAT TO THE POINT OF CAUSING A SECONDARY FIRE IN THE ELECTRICAL TRAY AT SOME POINT ALONG THE PATH OF THE CABLE (INCLUDING THE CONTROL ROOM) OR POSSIBLY HEAT UP TO THE POINT OF CAUSING DAMAGE TO ADJACENT CABLES THAT MAY BE REQUIRED FOR SAFE SHUTDOWN."" FOR THE GROUND FAULT HOT SHORT PHENOMENON IDENTIFIED IN THIS OE TO CAUSE A SECONDARY FIRE, ONE OR MORE ENERGIZED CONDUCTORS FROM THE SAME POWER SOURCE AS THE CIRCUIT UNDER ANALYSIS (AMMETER CIRCUIT) MUST ALSO BE SUSCEPTIBLE TO FIRE DAMAGE. ASSUMING THAT THE ENERGIZED CONDUCTORS FROM THE SAME POWER SOURCE ARE LOCATED IN THE SAME RACEWAY AS THE AMMETER CABLES/CONDUCTORS, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A VIABLE CONDUCTION PATH THROUGH A GROUNDED SURFACE IS EXTREMELY REMOTE DUE TO THE FOLLOWING: A. REQUIRES GROUND FAULT HOT SHORTS ON TWO DIFFERENT CABLES FROM THE SAME BATTERY SOURCE WITHOUT MAKING INTRA-CABLE (INTERNAL CONDUCTOR CONTACT WITHIN THE SAME CABLE) ELECTRICAL CONTACT (I.E. NOT RESULTING IN A POSITIVE TO NEGATIVE SHORT THAT WOULD OPEN THE FUSE SUPPLYING THE FAULT CURRENT). B. IN ORDER FOR THIS TO OCCUR A BOLTED FAULT TO THE RACEWAY MUST BE PRESENT ON THE SOURCE AND TARGET CONDUCTORS SUCH THAT SUFFICIENT CURRENT PASSES THROUGH THE GROUND PLANE. C. SINCE THE CABLE TRAYS AT UNIT 1 ARE FULL IT IS UNLIKELY THAT A BOLTED FAULT BETWEEN THE TARGET (AMMETER CABLE) AND THE SOURCE CABLE WOULD OCCUR WITHOUT ANY OTHER ADJACENT CABLES WITHIN THE RACEWAY EXPERIENCING THE SAME FAULT. AT NMP1, IN FIRE AREAS WHERE THE CABLES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AMMETERS ARE ROUTED, THE FIRE AREAS ARE EQUIPPED WITH DETECTION AND AUTOMATIC SUPPRESSION. THE POSTULATED FIRE INDUCED CIRCUIT FAILURE AND THE RESULTANT FIRE SCENARIO IN THE OE IS NOT CONSIDERED A LIKELY SCENARIO. THE GROUND FAULT HOT SHORTS IN THE DC CIRCUITS ARE CONSIDERED A ""PLAUSIBLE"" CIRCUIT FAILURE BY THE PIRT GROUP (THE INDUSTRY WORKING GROUP WHO IS EVALUATING THE RESULTS FROM THE DESIREE FIRE TESTING). HOWEVER, THE CIRCUIT FAILURE TYPE IDENTIFIED IN THIS OE WAS NOT OBSERVED OR WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE DESIREE FIRE TESTING AND IS NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN THE PIRT FINAL REPORT. THE AMMETERS DISCUSSED IN THIS CR ARE CONSIDERED SAFETY RELATED HOWEVER THEY DO NOT PERFORM ANY ACTIVE SAFETY RELATED FUNCTION AND THEREFORE ARE FOR INDICATION ONLY. THE AMMETERS ARE NOT CREDITED FOR SAFE SHUTDOWN OF THE PLANT. FOR NMP UNIT 1 DUE TO THE CONTROL ROOM BEING A CONTINUOUSLY MANNED AREA, A FIRE WOULD BE DETECTED IN THE INCIPIENT STAGE OF FIRE PROPAGATION. THE FIRE WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY DETECTED AND SUPPRESSED. THERE IS A LIMITED AREA OF CONCERN FOR THE CABLE RUNS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL ROOM; THESE CABLE TRAYS HAVE DEDICATED FIRE SUPPRESSION AND DETECTION. THEREFORE IF A FIRE WERE TO OCCUR, IT WOULD BE PROMPTLY DETECTED AND SUPPRESSED. CABLE TRAYS ARE ALSO COATED WITH FLAMASTIC IN THE AREA SURROUNDING THE SAFETY RELATED BATTERY BOARDS WHICH PREVENTS FIRE PROPAGATION IN THIS AREA.

Detailed Description: AFTER A REVIEW OF RECENT INDUSTRY FINDINGS AND THE RECOMMENDATION OF EXELON CORPORATE FIRE PROTECTION PERSONNEL, A SECOND EXTENT OF CONDITION REVIEW WAS DONE FOR THE ISSUE DESCRIBED IN CR-2013-008747, WITH THE REVIEW EXPANDED FROM JUST DC AMMETER CIRCUITS TO INCLUDE CIRCUITS FOR DC MOTORS (PUMP MOTORS AND MOV MOTORS). DC SYSTEM LOADS WERE REVIEWED FOR CASES WHERE CONTROL CIRCUITS WERE POWERED BY MOTIVE POWER CIRCUITS (I.E. CONTROL CIRCUIT PROTECTION WAS THROUGH A LARGE FUSE WHICH WOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROTECTION TO WIRING) OR WHERE FUSES HAD BEEN REPLACED WITH SOLID LINKS TO ENSURE RELIABILITY OF OIL PUMPS PROTECTING LARGE ASSETS SUCH AS THE TURBINE.

THE REVIEW IDENTIFIED VALVE IV-33-04, CLEANUP SUPPLY ISOLATION VALVE 12, POWERED FROM DC VALVE BOARD 12 WITH LARGE MOTOR FUSES (50A), HAS NO CONTROL POWER FUSES. THE VALVE IS A DC POWERED REACTOR VESSEL ISOLATION VALVE. NO OTHER DC VALVES OR PUMP MOTORS WERE IDENTIFIED AS PROBLEMS DURING THIS REVIEW. THE DESCRIBED CONDITION DOES NOT REPRESENT A CHALLENGE TO ANY REQUIRED TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION FUNCTIONS (OPERABILITY). PER APPROVED FIRE PROTECTION ENGINEERING EVALUATION FPEE1-90-014: ""ALL DC MOTOR-OPERATED REACTOR COOLANT SYSTEM ISOLATION VALVES (MOVS) WILL CLOSE AS DESIGNED UPON RECEIVING VESSEL ISOLATION SIGNAL ON LOW-LOW WATER LEVEL OR MANUAL INITIATION OF VESSEL ISOLATION."" THIS CONDITION DOES NOT IMPACT THIS FUNCTION OF THE VALVE. THE CONDUCTORS IN THE CONTROL CIRCUIT OF IV-33-04 ARE 12 AWG, IEEE-383 RATED, XLPE TYPE CABLES ACCORDING TO PLANT DRAWINGS AND THE CABLE RACEWAY DATABASE (TRAK2000). THE FUSES WHICH PROTECT THE VALVES MOTIVE POWER CIRCUIT ARE 50A FUSES DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE #4/0 MOTOR POWER CIRCUITS. THEY WILL NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE 12 AWG CONTROL CIRCUIT CABLING FROM FAULT CONDITIONS. THE CONCERN WITH THIS CONDITION IS THAT WHEN A FIRE OCCURS IN AN AREA OF THE PLANT, THE CONTROL CIRCUIT CONDUCTORS COULD SHORT TOGETHER WITH THE CORRECT AMOUNT OF RESISTANCE IN THE CONNECTION SUCH THAT THE CONDUCTORS ARE DAMAGED BY EXCESS CURRENT WHICH THE FUSE DOES NOT CLEAR AS IT HAS BEEN SIZED TOO LARGE. THIS COULD CAUSE SECONDARY FIRES ALONG THE CABLE ROUTE, WHICH DOES NOT MEET THE STATEMENTS IN UFSAR APPENDIX 10B SECTION 5.9.3, WHICH STATES THAT ALL CONDUCTORS HAVE PROPERLY SIZED PROTECTIVE DEVICES SUCH THAT ANY FAULT CONDITION IS INTERRUPTED BEFORE BREAKDOWN OF CABLE INSULATION RESULTS IN IGNITION OUTSIDE THE FIRE AREA OF CONCERN. CONDUCTORS THAT MAKE UP THE CONTROL CIRCUIT FOR IV-33-04 ARE CONTAINED WITHIN THREE (3) CABLES AS INDICATED BY PLANT DRAWINGS, THE CABLES ARE 12DV-26, 12DV-27 AND 12DV-28. A REVIEW OF THE CABLES ROUTING WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF AN UNCLEARED FAULT CONDITION REMAINING ON THE CABLE WOULD CAUSE SECONDARY FIRES IN AREAS BEYOND THE FIRE AREA OF CONCERN. CABLE 12DV-28 IS ONLY PRESENT IN ONE FIRE AREA AND SCREENED OUT. CABLES 12DV-26 AND 12DV-27 FROM DC VALVE BOARD 12 TO THE REACTOR BUILDING (FIRE AREA 1), THE CABLE SPREADING ROOM (FIRE AREA 10), AND THE AUXILIARY CONTROL ROOM (FIRE AREA 11). AS THESE CABLES ARE XLPE TYPE, IEEE-383 RATED CABLES, THE CONCLUSIONS OF FPEE2-14-001 STATE THAT THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO IGNITE AND CAUSE SECONDARY FIRES DUE TO OVERCURRENT CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, THEY MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO CABLES ROUTED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THEM, THEREFORE A REVIEW OF THE CONTENTS OF THE RACEWAYS WHERE THESE CABLES ARE ROUTED WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE IF ANY SAFE SHUTDOWN EQUIPMENT WOULD BE IMPACTED. BOTH CABLES 12DV-26 AND 12DV-27 WERE FOUND TO BE ROUTED IN CABLE TRAYS WITH OTHER SAFE SHUTDOWN CABLES, INCLUDING THOSE THAT SUPPORT THE CREDITED SAFE SHUTDOWN TRAIN.

THE INSPECTION REPORT STATES: ""THE INSPECTORS IDENTIFIED A SEVERITY LEVEL IV NCV OF REGULATIONS IN THAT UNIT 1 INAPPROPRIATELY RETRACTED AN EVENT NOTIFICATION REPORT (ENR) AND SUBSEQUENTLY FAILED TO MAKE THE REQUIRED LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) FOR A VALID ACTUATION OF THE HPCI SYSTEM. SPECIFICALLY, CONSTELLATION INAPPROPRIATELY RETRACTED ENR NUMBER 48477, AN 8-HOUR NOTIFICATION FOR A VALID HPCI ACTUATION AND FAILED TO SUBMIT AN LER WITHIN 60 DAYS OF DISCOVERY OF THE ACTUATION. CONSTELLATION ENTERED THIS ISSUE INTO THEIR CAP AS CR-2013-001859. THE INSPECTORS DETERMINED THAT THE INAPPROPRIATE RETRACTION OF A NOTIFICATION REQUIRED AND FAILURE TO MAKE A REQUIRED EVENT REPORT WERE PERFORMANCE DEFICIENCIES THAT WERE REASONABLY WITHIN CONSTELLATION'S ABILITY TO FORESEE AND CORRECT AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED. BECAUSE THIS ISSUE HAD THE POTENTIAL TO AFFECT THE NRC'S ABILITY TO PERFORM ITS REGULATORY FUNCTION, THE INSPECTORS EVALUATED THESE PERFORMANCE DEFICIENCIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRADITIONAL ENFORCEMENT PROCESS. USING EXAMPLE 6.9.D.9 FROM THE NRC ENFORCEMENT POLICY, THE INSPECTORS DETERMINED THAT THE VIOLATION WAS A SEVERITY LEVEL IV (MORE THAN MINOR CONCERN THAT RESULTED IN NO OR RELATIVELY INAPPRECIABLE POTENTIAL SAFETY OR SECURITY CONSEQUENCE) VIOLATION. BECAUSE THIS VIOLATION INVOLVES THE TRADITIONAL ENFORCEMENT PROCESS AND DOES NOT HAVE AN UNDERLYING TECHNICAL VIOLATION THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED MORE THAN MINOR, THE INSPECTORS DID NOT ASSIGN A CROSS-CUTTING ASPECT TO THIS VIOLATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROCEDURES.""

SHORTFALLS IN CLEAR PROBLEM STATEMENTS, USE OF CAUSE ANALYSIS TOOLS, LACK OF DEPTH IN THE ANALYSIS, ALIGNMENT OF CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TO IDENTIFIED CAUSES, LACK OF DOCUMENTATION AND INCOMPLETE EFFECTIVENESS REVIEW PLANS. 

b "" SOME PROBLEM STATEMENTS DO NOT CLEARLY STATE THE PROBLEM

1) CR-2012-001018 - THE PROBLEM STATEMENT WAS WRITTEN, "" THIS CR DOCUMENTS THE OFFICIAL RESULTS OF AN NRC INSPECTION WHICH REVIEWED ACTIONS FOR AN UNRESOLVED ITEM (URI) CONCERNING THE SECOND LEVEL (DEGRADED GRID) VOLTAGE PROTECTION SCHEME STEMMING FROM THE 2008 NMP COMPONENT DESIGN BASIS INSPECTION (CDBI).

b "" SOME TIER 1 AND 2 ACES DO NOT PROPERLY USE CAUSAL ANALYSIS TOOLS BOTH IN DOCUMENTING THE CAUSAL TOOL RESULTS, EVALUATING OTHER DISCOUNTED CAUSES AND DRIVING PAST HARDWARE DISCUSSIONS TO ORGANIZATIONAL/PROGRAMMATIC ISSUES.

1) CR-2012-001018 USED A EVENT & CAUSAL FACTOR (E&CF) CHART AND COMPARATIVE TIMELINE. THE E&CF ONLY HAS THE EVENTS AND CAUSES. THERE IS NO ANALYSIS OF HOW THE EVALUATOR DETERMINED THE CAUSE. THE COMPARATIVE TIMELINE IN THE CR DOES NOT FOLLOW THE FORMAT FOR A COMPARATIVE TIMELINE. IT DROPPED THE ANALYSIS COLUMNS. THEREFORE IT IS NOT CLEAR HOW THE APPARENT AND CONTRIBUTING CAUSES WERE DETERMINED.

2) APPARENT CAUSE CR-2012-009540 STATED, ""THE APPARENT CAUSE STATES THAT THE PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THE PROCEDURE DEVELOPMENT DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR, NOR COORDINATE REVIEWS WITH OTHER KEY TEAM MEMBERS, I.E. NO CROSS-DISCIPLINARY REVIEWS. THIS CAUSE SHOULD HAVE GONE ONE LEVEL DEEPER TO DETERMINE WHY THE RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS DID MADE THE ERROR AND DID NOT GET THE APPROPRIATE REVIEWS. THE CONTRIBUTING CAUSE STATED. ""TRAINING DID NOT ADEQUATELY PREPARE PERSONNEL TO RECOGNIZE THE REPORTABLE CONDITION, WHICH THEN ALLOWED THE PROCEDURE TO BE PUT INTO PLACE, TRAIN ON AND IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE YEARS UNTIL IT WAS RECOGNIZED ON 10/18/12. CONTRIBUTING CAUSE "" THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION OF THE ADEQUACY OF PROGRAMS OR PROCESSES THAT ARE USED TO CONTROL PROCEDURE CHANGES. THE CAUSE ROAD MAP AND WHY STAIRCASE WERE USED BUT ONLY FOCUSED ON THE MINDSET AND USE OF ASSUMPTIONS CONCLUDING TRAINING WAS A PROBLEM. NOTE THE CAUSE IDENTIFIED FORM THE USE OF THE CAUSE ROAD MAP AND WHEY STAIRCASE ALIGN WITH THE CONTRIBUTING CAUSE NOT THE APPARENT CAUSE.

3) CR-2012-000476 - THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY ANALYSIS TOOLS WERE USED FOR THIS CR. ALSO, THE EVALUATION NOTED THAT THERE WAS A PROCEDURE COMPLIANCE ISSUE BUT IT WAS NOT EVALUATED. THE APPARENT CAUSE IS A DIRECT CAUSE RATHER THAN A MORE FUNDAMENTAL CAUSE ""THAT THE MOST PROBABLE DIRECT CAUSE FOR THE DEGRADED CELL WAS A MANUFACTURING DEFECT THAT LED TO A DIRECT SHORT."" CC#1 IS NOT ALIGNED WITH THE PROBLEM IT IDENTIFIES SEVERAL ISSUES RELATED TO PROBLEMS WITH RAISING BATTERY CELL VOLTAGE IF IT IS FOUND DEGRADED.

4) CATEGORY 2 TIER 2, CR -2012-006661, ""CHRONIC RECURRING ISSUE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED ON THE UNIT 2 6TH POINT FEEDWATER HEATER"" STATES THE FOLLOWING. ""NOTES: 1) SINCE THIS CAUSAL EVALUATION HAS RESULTED IN THE SAME CONCLUSIONS AS PRIOR EVALUATIONS, AN ACTION HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO SUBMIT THE APPLICABLE TRENDING DATA, DRAWINGS, AND FMEA TO THE OEM OR INDUSTRY/FLEET SME'S FOR REVIEW TO CORROBORATE THESE CONCLUSIONS. 2) C91942585 HAS BEEN INITIATED FOR REPAIR AND WILL INCLUDE PERFORMANCE OF REPAIRS AS RECOMMENDED FROM THE REVIEW OUTLINED ABOVE AND THIS CAUSAL ANALYSIS."" SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS TAKEN WITH THE VENDOR CONFIRMED THE CONCLUSIONS OF THE ACE WITH THE ONLY ESTABLISHED CORRECTIVE ACTION BEING TO REPAIR THE HEATER. THE APPARENT CAUSE DOES NOT INVESTIGATE WHY PREVIOUS CORRECTIVE ACTIONS FOR THE SAME CAUSE HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE AND MERELY ESTABLISHES ANOTHER REPAIR ACTION BASED ON VENDOR RECOMMENDATIONS.

5) CR-2013-003497 IDENTIFIES THAT THE TURBINE SYSTEM ENGINEER DID NOT INITIALLY STOP THE JOB AND GET THE SUPERVISOR INVOLVED WHEN THE ELECTRICIANS WERE UNRESPONSIVE TO THIS CONCERNS ABOUT JOB SAFETY. THE UNDERLYING CAUSE FOR THIS FAILED BARRIER IS NOT EVALUATED

THE ACTION WAS CLOSED TO A PENDING PCR WITH NO ACTIONS ADDED TO THE CR TO TRACK CLOSURE. ADDITIONALLY CLOSURE DOCUMENTATION IS NOT ATTACHED FOR THIS CATEGORY 2 TIER 2 ACTION AS REQUIRED BY CNG-CA-1.01-1000.

2) CATEGORY 3 CORRECTIVE CA-2012-004725 STATES, ""REVIEW AND ATTACH FAILURE ANALYSIS TO THIS CONDITION REPORT AND DETERMINE IF FURTHER ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED BASED ON THE FAILURE ANALYSIS REPORT AND DOCUMENT FINDINGS IN THIS ACTION."" THE CLOSURE FOR THIS ACTIONS STATES, ""THE FLEXIBLE TUBING WAS REALIGNED AND SHOULD PROVIDE MANY YEARS OF SERVICE. A WORK ORDER C92253372 HAS BEEN WRITTEN AND IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR REMOVAL & REPLACEMENT IN 2015.

CONTRARY TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF CA-2012-004725, AN ACTION WAS NOT CREATED TO INCORPORATE THE PCR INTO THE PROCEDURE.

NEW ACTIONS ARE TO BE GENERATED IF THE RESULTS WARRANT."" THE CLOSURE TO THIS ACTION STATES THAT A2P WAS FOUND NORMAL THROUGH ANALYSIS AND NOT A CONTRIBUTOR TO THE EVENT. CONTRARY TO THIS, THE ROOT CAUSE WAS NOT REVISED.

4) CORRECTIVE CA-2011-002504 (CR-2011-005458) STATES, ""SHIP ACTUATOR BACK TO VENDOR FOR A COMPREHENSIVE TEST TO BE PERFORMED AND EVALUATE FINDINGS. CA UPDATED WITH VENDOR FAILURE ANALYSIS RESULTS. BASED ON VENDOR ANALYSIS ADDITIONAL ACTIONS MAY BE REQUIRED."" THE CR STATES, ""A CONTRIBUTING CAUSE OF THE ACTUATOR FAILURE IS THE PM WAS RESCHEDULED THREE TIMES DUE TO UNAVAILABILITY OF SPARE ACTUATORS. THE THIRD SCHEDULE CHANGE REQUIRED A PM DEFERRAL TO PREVENT EXCEEDING THE GRACE DATE. A DEFERRAL WAS REQUIRED DUE TO A PAST HISTORY OF PARTS HAVING VERY LONG LEAD TIMES AND DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING PROMPT FUNDING FOR REFURBISHMENT OF REMOVED ACTUATORS. THE PM WAS ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED FOR 1049J THEN CHANGED TO WORK WEEK 1118F. AS A RESULT OF THE PM DEFERRAL THE WORK WAS RESCHEDULED TO 1140B WEEK. THIS ACTUATOR FAILURE OCCURRED DURING WORK WEEK 1123J. THE 6 YEAR PM FOR REPLACEMENT OF THE UNIT EXCEEDED THE ORIGINAL GRACE DATE CAUSING THE SEAL TO DEGRADE FURTHER DUE TO EXCESSIVE TIME IN SERVICE.""

5) CONDITION REPORT CR-2011-004307 DOCUMENTS THE FAILURE OF BV 70-69, REACTOR BUILDING CLOSED LOOP COOLING INLET TO 12 FUEL POOL HEAT EXCHANGER. THIS FAILURE WAS DETERMINED TO BE A CRITICAL COMPONENT FAILURE ACCORDING TO THE MAINTENANCE RULE PAGE. THE FOLLOWING APPARENT CAUSE WAS STATED, ""THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE EVENT IS AN INTERMITTENT PROBLEM WITH THE SOV. ""CA-2011-00931 WAS CREATED TO PERFORM A FAILURE ANALYSIS. CA-2011-001932 WAS WRITTEN TO, ""DETERMINE PROBABLE CAUSE OF BV-70-69."" SINCE THE SOLENOID WAS NEVER REMOVED FROM SERVICE, THE FOLLOWING CLOSURE WAS WRITTEN, ""A FAILURE ANALYSIS WAS NOT COMPLETED BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL SOV WAS NEVER REMOVED FROM SERVICE. THIS ACTION CAN BE CLOSED SINCE SUBSEQUENT TESTING TO N1-ST-Q12 REVEALED NO ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS WITH THE VALVE. THE EVENT TOOK PLACE ON 4/27/11. N1-ST-Q12 WAS PERFORMED ON 5/2/11, 7/6/11, 10/31/11 AND MOST RECENTLY ON 1/5/12, ALL WITHOUT REPORTED ISSUES. APPARENT CAUSE OF VALVE NOT OPENING AS DISCUSSED IN CR-2011-004307 WAS INTERMITTENT SOV FAILURE. NO FURTHER ACTION IS REQUIRED. THIS ACTION CLOSURE HAS RECEIVED THE SAME LEVEL OF REVIEW AS THE ORIGINAL CR DISPOSITION."" THE ONLY CORRECTIVE ACTION CLOSURE STATED FOR THIS CRITICAL COMPONENT FAILURE WAS, ""A REQUIREMENT WAS ADDED TO WO C91299950 TO REPLACE THE SOV DURING VALVE MAINTENANCE. A NOTE TO PROVIDE THE REMOVED SOV TO THE AOV COMPONENT ENGINEER WAS ALSO ADDED TO THE WO. THE REMOVED SOV WILL BE SENT OUT FOR FAILURE ANALYSIS BY THE AOV COMPONENT ENGINEER. NO ACTIONS WERE CREATED IN THE CR TO COMPLETE THESE ACTIVITIES. THE CATEGORY 2 CR WAS CLOSED TO AN INTERMITTENT FAILURE AND NO CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN.

6) CR-2011-001455, ""ADVERSE TREND IN PHASE SEQUENCE RELAY FAILURES ON IRON PREFILTER AIR COMPRESSORS,"" DETERMINED THE APPARENT CAUSE TO BE, ""THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THE FAILURES IS HIGH AMBIENT TEMPERATURE RESULTING IN PHASE SEQUENCE RELAY COMPONENT DEGRADATION, AND ULTIMATELY PREMATURE FAILURE. SEE ATTACHED FMEA FOR ANALYSIS."" CA-2011-000909, WAS CREATED TO, ""SEND FAILED PHASE SEQUENCE RELAYS TO OUTSIDE VENDOR FOR FAILURE ANALYSIS"" AND ADD ACTIONS AS NECESSARY. THE VENDOR ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSFORMER WAS NOT PROPERLY RATED. A CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS CREATED TO REPLACE THE TRANSFORMER WITH A NEW DESIGN HOWEVER THE APPARENT CAUSE WAS NOT REVISED AND STILL EVALUATES AND PROVIDES THE BASIS OF HIGH AMBIENT TEMPERATURES WITH NO ASSOCIATED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS.

7) CR-2011-0057692 DETERMINED THAT FOREIGN MATERIAL INTRUSION INTO THE SPOOL AND CAGE ASSEMBLY WAS THE CAUSE OF THE #13 FEEDWATER CONTROL VALVE BINDING. SUBSEQUENT ENHANCEMENT ACTIONS LATER DETERMINED THAT SIDE THRUSTING OF THE CV-7 SIDE MANIFOLD WAS LEADING TO GALLING OF THE SPOOL AND CAGE. DUE TO THE SOFTER NITRONIC-60 MATERIAL OF THE SPOOL AND CAGE, FOREIGN MATERIAL WAS PRODUCED LEADING TO THE EVENTUAL BINDING OF THE FLOW CONTROL VALVE. THE LATER LEARNING'S GATHERED FROM ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS WERE NOT REVISED BACK INTO THE ACE. AS A RESULT ALTHOUGH ACTIONS TO CORRECT THE CONDITION WERE PROPERLY TAKEN, THE ACE STILL REFLECTS THAT THE REVISION TO THE PROCEDURE TO CLEAN THE PARTS PRIOR TO ASSEMBLY WOULD PREVENT REOCCURRENCE. ACTUAL ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE ACE NOR IS THE CAUSE OF EXTENT OF CAUSE CORRECT.

THE INDICATED FLOW WOULD OCCASIONALLY DRIFT DOWN TO 0.50 SCFH, AND CAUSE THE CONTROL ROOM ALARMS AND THE SKID WOULD LEAVE THE 'OPER' MODE. HOWEVER, THE SAMPLE SKID WAS COMPLETELY ISOLATED FROM ALL PROCESS FLOWS AND THE SAMPLE PUMPS WERE SECURED. THEREFORE THE SAMPLE FLOW RATE SHOULD HAVE READ APPROXIMATELY 0 (ZERO), AND THE SYSTEM SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN 'OPER' MODE. THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) HAS BEEN CONTACTED FOR GUIDANCE, AND TROUBLE SHOOTING HAS BEGUN. THIS CR IS TO DOCUMENT THE UNEXPECTED ALARMS, AND SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR REWORK.

Detailed Description: DURING PERFORMANCE OF A TYPE B LEAKRATE FOR THE NMP1 PERSONNEL AIR LOCK WHEN TEST PRESSURE WAS NOT ABLE TO BE ATTAINED AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE TEST COULD NOT BE COMPLETED, THE SURVEILLANCE WAS PLACED ON HOLD. THE PREVALENT BELIEVE WAS THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE INNER DOOR SEAL ALLOWING AIR FROM INSIDE THE AIRLOCK TO GO PAST THE DOOR SEALS AND INTO THE CONTAINMENT. THOUGH THE BELIEF WAS THAT THERE WAS A SEAL PROBLEM REQUIRING REPLACEMENT AND THE TEST WAS NOT ABLE TO BE SATISFACTORILY COMPLETED THE TEST WAS NOT DECLARED UNSAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATION PROCEDURES AND TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS. THIS THEN RESULTED IN THE FAILURE TO ENTER THE RESPECTIVE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION (TS) LIMITING CONDITION FOR OPERATION (LCO) ACTION AND FAILURE TO ENTERED A ONE-HOUR SHUTDOWN ACTION STATEMENT DURING THE COURSE OF INVESTIGATION AND REPAIR OF THE AIRLOCK. 

SUPPORTING INFORMATION: 
1. MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL WERE NOT ABLE TO ATTAIN THE REQUIRED TEST PRESSURE WHEN TESTING THE PERSONNEL AIR LOCK AT NMP1 INDICATING THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT LEAK FROM THE AIRLOCK SYSTEM. AS A RESULT THE TEST WAS PUT ON HOLD AND PLANS WERE MADE TO REPLACE THE INNER DOOR SEAL. 
2. THE INNER DOOR SEAL WAS POSTULATED TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE INABILITY TO PRESSURIZE THE AIRLOCK BASED ON HAVING SNOOPED THE OUTER DOOR AND FINDING NO LEAKS COUPLED WITH THE HISTORICAL OE NMP HAS HAD WITH INNER DOOR SEAL PROBLEMS. 
3. NO CR WAS WRITTEN FOR THE DEGRADED CONDITION OF THE PERSONNEL AIRLOCK OR INABILITY TO ATTAIN TEST PRESSURE DURING THE SURVEILLANCE CONDUCTED MAY 15, 2013. THUS NO FORMAL OPERABILITY SCREENING WAS PERFORMED. 
4. BASED ON SOMS LOGS THE OCC STAFF WAS AWARE OF THIS CONDITION AS EARLY AS 1329. THE CONTROL ROOM WAS NOT INFORMED UNTIL 1430. 
5. THERE WERE SOME DISCUSSIONS AMONG SUPERVISION THAT THIS TEST MAY BE A ""NO-TEST"", HOWEVER THE DECLARATION OF A ""NO-TEST"" WAS NOT DONE NOR DOCUMENTED. IN ADDITION, THE PROCEDURAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO CONSIDER THE FAILED TEST A ""NO-TEST"" WERE NOT MET. N1-SAT-01 REQUIRES IN PART TO BE CONSIDERED A ""NO-TEST"", THAT THE COMPLETED PORTION OF THE TEST HAS NOT PRODUCED ANY UNACCEPTABLE RESULTS AND THAT IF THE TEST CANNOT BE COMPLETED, THE REASON IS NOT DUE TO FAILED COMPONENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE TEST. TYPICAL REASONS THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED DUE TO COMPONENTS OF THE TEST WOULD BE A FLAWED TEST METHODOLOGY OR DEGRADED TEST EQUIPMENT. THE CONDITIONS ENCOUNTERED DURING THIS SURVEILLANCE TEST WOULD NOT HAVE LEGITIMATELY MET THE REQUIREMENTS NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO CALL IT A ""NO-TEST"". 
6. THE OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR WAS SUBSEQUENTLY BREACHED ON NIGHTSHIFT TO INSPECT AND REPAIR THE INNER DOOR SEAL. THE INNER DOOR SEAL WAS FOUND TO BE ROLLED FROM ITS PROPER LOCATION AND REPLACED. WHILE THE OUTER DOOR WAS OPEN AND THE INNER DOOR SEAL INOPERABLE THE EFFECT WAS THAT THE AIRLOCK SYSTEM WAS INOPERABLE. THIS CONDITION WAS AN UNRECOGNIZED ONE-HOUR SHUTDOWN LCO ACTION.

IN SUMMARY, THOUGH NUMEROUS SUPERVISORS/GENERAL SUPERVISORS ACROSS SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS AND THE OCC STAFF WERE AWARE OF THE CONDITION, FOLLOW-THROUGH ON THE SURVEILLANCE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA WAS NOT PERFORMED, THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PROGRAM NOT USED, AND APPROPRIATE TS LCO ACTIONS NEVER ENTERED.

In order to preserve the existing TMI LOCA analysis of record for PCT, AREVA recommended, and TMI has implemented, a 2 kw/ft penalty to LHR limits in Cycle 20 (10/20/14). The penalty has been applied through more restrictive operational imbalance limits. Statements Supporting Operability: Current TMI LOCA analyses have margin that is reduced by a 2 kw/ft penalty that offsets the deficient conductivity degradation modeling. Revised core operating limits for the current TMI-1 operating cycle ensure that PCT remains within the acceptance criteria for emergency core cooling systems (ECCS; <2200 F). In addition, a review of TMI-1 core operation over the past 3 years has shown that TMI has operated within the tighter Fq (LOCA LHR) limits imposed by AREVA on B&W-plants to ensure the current LOCA analysis remains unaffected by the TACO-3 TCD deficiency. Therefore, TMI-1's current LOCA PCT of 1890 F remains valid. Statements Supporting Reportability: The algebraic addition of the thermal conductivity degradation modeling deficiency with LHR penalty applied to TMI-1's current existing LOCA analyses results in a PCT within the required ECCS limits. Therefore TMI-1 continues to operate within the envelope of analyzed conditions. This newly analyzed condition is not an unanalyzed condition that significantly degrades plant safety. This condition does represent a significant change to the TMI-1 ECCS model temperature calculation and must be reported within 30 days.",[]
"This IR is being initiated to meet the requirements of LS-AA-1003, ""NRC Inspection Preparation and Response."" Per the procedure, once an NRC inspection report is issued with a Finding, Violation, or Unresolved Issue (URI) the NRC Coordinator is responsible for initiating an IR that requires the responsible organization to review the NRC violation and ensure that the station response and corrective actions properly address the violation. From the NRC 3rd Quarter 2014 Integrated Inspection Report (2014-004) issued on November 13, 2014:

Introduction:
The inspectors identified a finding of very low safety significance (Green) and an associated NCV when licensee personnel failed to adhere to Operability Determination Process standards after identifying a non-conforming condition that had the potential to impact the operability of the UHS.

Description:
On June 24, 2014, the licensee identified that station procedures used to address a failure of the Braidwood cooling lake dike did not include steps to secure nonsafety-related pumps, including circulating water pumps and non-essential service water pumps, that take a suction from the UHS and discharge to a location outside of the UHS. Securing these nonsafety-related pumps was a design assumption that was specified in the UFSAR and supported in an associated calculation. Following the discovery of this issue, the licensee generated IR 1674557, ""Question on UHS License Amendment Request Impact on Pumps,"" which documented that Abnormal Operating Procedure BwOA ENV.3, ""Braidwood Cooling Lake Low Level,"" did not direct nonsafety-related pumps that take a suction from the UHS and discharge outside of the UHS to be secured following a dike failure. During the review of this IR, on June 25, 2014, the inspectors noted that the ""Operability"" section of IR 1674557 was left blank, and the ""Reviewed"" section stated, in part, that the issue was ""a process issue regarding future planned actions."" The inspectors concluded from their review of IR 1674557 that although the title of IR 1674557 suggested that this issue only impacted future planned actions, the context discussed within the IR documented a condition that could adversely impact current UHS operability. As a result, the inspectors promptly discussed this issue with the Operations Shift Manager, who was not aware of any operability concerns associated with the issue or station actions to address the issue. Later, during that shift, the Shift Manager determined that the issue was reportable as an ""Unanalyzed Condition."" On June 25, 2014, IR1675291, ""Unanalyzed Condition Identified During IR 1674557 Response,"" was generated by the Engineering department. The licensee also implemented a Standing Order that included interim guidance. 

The Standing Order stated, in part, that:
""To preserve the UHS function in the event of cooling pond dike failure, the following guidance is provided until 0/1/2BwOA ENV.3 is revised. Braidwood Operations will take the following actions in the event of a dike failure and lake level is just above 590' (1ft. on 0LI.CW041): 
- Trip both Units 
- Secure all circulation water pumps 
- Secure all non-essential service water pumps by placing them in pull to lock 
- Secure all running main fire pumps (jockey pumps are excluded) 
- Perform the actions of 0/1/2BwOA ENV.3 and the Braidwood Cooling Pond Safety Emergency Plan""

The inspectors noted that IR 1674557 included a preliminary determination that operation of a single nonsafety-related service water pump at full flow would deplete the UHS in approximately 3.6 days and did not meet the 30 day mission time required by design. However, the inspectors also noted that the licensee's operability discussion in the IR stated, ""The UHS meets its surveillance requirements for minimum level, maximum temperature, and maximum bottom level. Limiting Condition for Operation 3.7.9 UHS is met and the UHS is operable."" The inspectors expressed a concern that the operability assessment did not specifically address the 30 day mission time discussed in the IR. 

The inspectors also noted that Step 2.14 of OP.AA.108.115 stated, in part, that, ""In order to be considered operable, structures, systems and components must be capable of performing safety functions specified by its design, within the required range of design physical conditions, initiation times and mission times."" Contrary to what the procedure specified, the licensee's operability assessment did not address mission time. Following conversations with site personnel, the licensee updated their operability assessment to reflect that even though procedural guidance did not explicitly reflect the assumptions in the UHS analysis in that nonsafety-related pumps were not directed to be secured, the UHS would still be able to perform its safety function since operators would recognize the problem and take actions to secure the nonsafety-related pumps. When questioned by the inspectors on what would prompt the operators to take action to secure nonsafety-related pumps, what procedures would be used, and how these actions ensured the specified safety function would be met, the licensee was unable to provide further information other than what had already been presented. In July 2014, the licensee completed a past operability evaluation, which provided the bases for UHS TS operability consistent with the definition of operability in the site-specific TSs. In the evaluation, the licensee concluded that based on the breach size evaluated in station calculations of record it would take approximately 16 hours to drain the lake level from 594 feet to 591 feet 10 inches. The UHS TS minimum level was 590 feet. At 591 feet 10 inches, minimum submergence to satisfy net positive suction head requirements for the nonsafety-related service water pumps would not be met. The vendor for the pump specified that at that point a vortex could form, which could introduce air into the pump. The vendor also specified that unless the pump became air bound, the pump would continue to operate, but with reduced performance. Based upon this information, the licensee did not predict at what lake level the pump would cease to operate. The licensee concluded that mechanical pump vibrations, fluctuations in pump discharge pressure, and variations in motor currents would likely require that an operator trip the nonsafety-related service water pumps to prevent damage before 590' lake level was reached.

The inspectors reviewed the licensee's past operability determination, timeline of events, and the Operability Determination Procedure, and identified the following examples where the procedure standard was not followed:
- Step 4.1.2 of OP.AA.108.115, stated that, ""If the originator or supervisor identifies any potential operability or reportability issues, the originator or supervisor shall personally contact Operations Shift Management of the affected facility/unit and discuss the issue."" However, upon discovery on June 24, 2014, that nonsafety-related pumps would not be secured following a lake dike failure, although this was assumed in design basis calculations, licensee personnel did not inform Operations Shift Management. The licensee documented this issue in IR 1681326 ""Untimely Notification to Shift Manager of a Potential Plant Issue.""
- Step 2.14 of OP.AA.108.115, stated, in part, that, ""In order to be considered operable, structures, systems and components must be capable of performing safety functions specified by its design, within the required range of design physical conditions, initiation times and mission times."" However, the licensee's operability assessment discussed in IR 1674557 and IR 1675291 did not address mission time even though Engineering had determined that the identified issue had the potential to affect mission time. The operability assessment specified that operators would recognize the problem and take actions to ensure that the UHS would still be able to perform its safety function and meet all design basis requirements. However, the licensee did not adequately consider what would prompt the operators to take action, what procedures they would use, and how the actions correlated to meeting the specified safety function.
- Step 4.5.2.5 of OP.AA.108.115 stated, in part, that, ""The technical acceptability and effectiveness of a compensatory measure with respect to the degraded or non-conforming condition and the affected structures, systems and components should be evaluated. The evaluation should also consider the effects of the compensatory measures to other aspects of the facility."" However, when instituting the Standing Order, no evaluation was performed even though the Standing Order met the procedural definition of what constituted a compensatory measure. 

The licensee entered the issues described above into their CAP as IR1674557 and IR 1675291. Corrective actions for this issue included revising procedures to secure nonsafety-related pumps upon reaching a low lake level condition consistent with plant design calculations, and addressing the untimely notification of the shift.

Analysis:
The inspectors determined that the failure to adhere to the Operability Determination Process standard outlined in OP.AA.108.115, Revision 13, during the evaluation of a non-conforming condition that affected the UHS was a performance deficiency. The inspectors determined that the performance deficiency was more than minor in accordance with IMC 0612, Appendix B, ""Issue Screening,"" because the issue was associated with the Design Control attribute of the Mitigating Systems Cornerstone and adversely affected the cornerstone objective of ensuring the availability, reliability, and capability of systems that respond to initiating events to prevent undesirable consequences (i.e., core damage). Specifically, based on the analysis of record at the time of discovery, there was reasonable doubt that the UHS could meet its mission time of 30 days. The inspectors determined the finding could be evaluated using the SDP in accordance with IMC 0609, ""Significance Determination Process,"" Attachment 0609.04, ""Initial Characterization of Findings,"" dated June 19, 2012, and Appendix A, ""The Significance Determination Process for Findings At-Power,"" Exhibit 2, ""Mitigating Systems Screening Questions,"" dated June 19, 2012. The inspectors determined that the finding did not result in the confirmed loss of operability, and therefore the finding screened as having very low safety significance (Green). The inspectors concluded that this finding had a cross-cutting aspect in the Conservative Bias component of the Human Performance cross-cutting area because the licensee failed to use conservative assumptions in their decision-making when analyzing the operability of the UHS. Specifically, Operations did not request a documented evaluation to support understanding why the UHS was operable, and verify that their assumptions regarding operator actions were feasible (H.14).

Enforcement:
Criterion V, ""Instructions, Procedures, and Drawings,"" requires, in part, that activities affecting quality be prescribed and accomplished by instructions, procedures, and drawings appropriate to the circumstances, and shall be accomplished in accordance with those instructions, procedures, and drawings. The licensee implemented the operability determination process (an activity affecting quality) using procedure OP.AA.108.115, ""Operability Determination Procedure,"" Revision 13. Step 2.14 of OP.AA.108.115 stated, in part: ""In order to be considered operable structures, systems and components must be capable of performing safety functions specified by its design, within the required range of design, physical conditions, initiation times, and mission times."" Step 4.1.2 of OP.AA.108.115 stated: ""If the originator or supervisor identifies any potential operability or reportability issues, the originator or supervisor shall personally contact Operations Shift Management of the affected facility/unit and discuss the issue."" Step 4.1.3 of OP.AA.108.115 stated: ""Route the issue for immediate review by Operations Shift Management when immediate actions are required by operations."" Step 4.5.2.5 of OP.AA.108.115 stated, in part: ""The technical acceptability and effectiveness of a Compensatory Measure with respect to the degraded or non-conforming condition and the affected structures, systems and components should be evaluated. The evaluation should also consider the effects of the compensatory measures on other aspects of the facility."" Contrary to the above, on June 25, 2014, following the discovery of a non-conforming condition in the UHS, licensee personnel failed to notify the shift management upon discovery of a potential operability concern, failed to adequately assess operability based on information provided by Engineering which specified that the condition could lead to not meeting the mission time, and failed to evaluate compensatory measures as required by procedure OP.AA.108.115. Corrective actions for this issue included revising procedures to secure nonsafety-related pumps prior to reaching a low lake level condition consistent with plant design calculations, and addressing the untimely notification of the shift management. Because this violation was of very low safety significance and it was entered into the licensee's CAP as IR 1674557 and IR 1675291, this violation is being treated as an NCV, consistent with Section 2.3.2 of the NRC Enforcement Policy (NCV 05000456/2014004.02; 05000457/2014004.02, Multiple Failures to Follow Operability Evaluation Process Following Discovery of a Non-Conforming Condition in the Ultimate Heat Sink).",['50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B)']

"During routine trending of radiochemistry data, Reactor Engineering identified trends in Unit 2 which would indicate the presence of one or more failed fuel pins. Based on the relevant isotopes, magnitudes, and durations, the nature of this failure is consistent with that of the late cycle, peripheral low power, grid-to-rod-fretting failures we've seen at CCNPP in recent operating cycles. The Xe133/Xe135 to Kr88/Xe133 ratio is divergent which indicates the presence of failed fuel. I-131 remains steady with Xe-133 trending upward; both indicate the presence of low power leaker(s) indicative of the type seen at CCNPP for several years. It cannot be determined from the data if the failures are in the 24 Westinghouse Turbo assemblies or the 24 Areva HTP assemblies. This is an Action Level 1 failure per NF-AA-430 (the least severe level). No Tech Spec related limits (including DEI) are challenged. This condition does not result in principal safety barriers being seriously degraded or operating in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degrades plant safety.",[]

Upon startup, it was discovered that 0VC312Y (Outside air intake) was open and 0VC25Y (turbine building intake) was closed. This was an unexpected condition and 0VC312Y should have been closed and 0VC25Y should have been open. Operators verified the M/U filter select switch was in Auto as expected. At 09:39, the HELB Detection Panel (0VC01JE) red light was lit indicating HELB switch actuation had occurred. After initial troubleshooting, it was discovered that the most likely cause of the HELB actuation was from the 0A VC Return fan vibration data gathering when the plenum door was opened causing pressure transients. At 10:08, the 0A VC M/U fan was shut-down and the HELB signal was reset. The 0A VC M/U fan and filter were placed back online and the dampers operated as expected (0VC312Y Closed and OVC25Y Open).

"The Backup Gamma Spec computer was found ""off"" as the result of an unknown hardware issue. The Primary computer remains functional. Gamma spec is used as EP equipment currently to monitor Fuel Clad Threshold an FC.1 EAL (DEI-131 > 300 uCi/g) under EP-AA-1007, Addendum 3. The Primary computer can still be used to count samples but the system reliability (i.e. ""2 out of 2"") as required by the original design is reduced. Therefore, if the Primary computer is lost, the Site can no longer declare analyze reactor coolant for monitoring threshold FC.1.

"CONDITION DESCRIPTION: H03D SITE: North Anna Power Station Unit 1 SUBJECT: Inadvertent Loss of Vital Instrumentation During Maintenance Due to Personnel Error . ICES #: 3382014002 SUMMARY: On December 10, 2014, at 1344 hours, two channels of the Unit 1 Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST) level instrumentation were inadvertently removed from service at the same time during maintenance. Operations personnel responded by entering abnormal procedure 1-AP-3, Loss of Vital Instrumentation. Additionally, Technical Specification (TS) 3.0.3 was entered due to two channels being inoperable that affect Recirculation Spray (RS) pump auto-start logic. Had a Containment Depressurization Actuation (CDA) occurred during this time, accident mitigation may have been impacted. At 1356 hours, both level indications returned to normal. At 1417 hours, Channel II was declared operable and TS 3.0.3 was cleared. At 1439 hours, Channel I was declared operable and TS Actions were cleared. The health and safety of the public were not affected by this event. DETAILED ISSUE DESCRIPTION: On December 10, 2014, at 1100 hours with Unit 1 (U1) in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, station technicians commenced scheduled periodic channel calibrations of level transmitters for U1 Refueling Water Storage Tank (EIIS System - BP, Component - TK) Level Channel I instrument loop (1-QS-L-100C) and Channel II instrument loop (1-QSL- 100D). A pre-job brief was performed emphasizing one channel instrument loop calibration at a time. Initial job preparations were established for Channel I instrument loop (1-QS-L-100C) calibration. Test equipment was staged in the instrument rack room and at the U1 Refueling Water Storage Tank (RWST) level transmitter (EIIS Component - LT). The lead technician proceeded to the Main Control Room (EIIS System - NA) to brief the Operations Senior Reactor Operator (SRO). Required procedure step signatures were obtained and permission was granted to perform the Channel II calibration. At 1258 hours Operations entered the 72 hour action statement for Technical Specification (TS) for performance of the Channel II instrument loop (1-QS-L-100D) calibration. Upon arrival to the instrument rack room the lead technician discovered Operations signatures were made in the test procedure for 1-QS-L-100D. At this time the test equipment was moved from the cabinet for 1-QS-L-100C to the cabinet for 1-QS-L-100D. When it was identified that the procedure was for the 1-QS-L-100D task, the lead technician did not specifically communicate the change to the field team. Subsequently, 1-QS-L-100D was removed from service and placed in test. The lead technician remained in the instrument rack room while two technicians proceeded to the RWST level transmitter for field work activities. At this point technicians simultaneously verified they were on transmitter 1-QS-L-100C using the working copy of the procedure and began isolating and draining the level transmitter. At 1344 hours, RWST Channel I instrument loop (1-QS-L-100C) level indication failed low with Channel II instrument loop (1-QS-L-100D) level transmitter having already been removed from service. Operations personnel responded by entering abnormal procedure 1-AP-3, Loss of Vital Instrumentation. Additionally, TS 3.0.3 was entered due to two channels inoperable that affect Recirculation Spray (RS) pump (EIIS System - BE, Component - P) auto-start capability. At 1356 hours, both level indications returned to normal. At 1417 hours, Channel II was declared operable and TS 3.0.3 was cleared. Had a Containment Depressurization Actuation (CDA) occurred during this time, accident mitigation may have been impacted. At 1439 hours, Channel I was declared operable. CAUSE: The cause of the event was due to personnel error. Station technicians failed to assess risk associated with the RWST level channel calibration tasks. Inattention as a result of repetition and/or becoming complacent and overconfident with the job task caused the team not to use human performance tools to mitigate the errors. Had the correct rigor for the task been addressed the event could have been prevented. CORRECTIVE ACTION: Channel II instrument loop (1-QS-L-100D) was returned to service by procedure and verified, a channel check was completed on the Main Control Room (MCR) board to verify proper indication. The TS Action of 3.0.3 was cleared. Channel I instrument loop (1-QS-L-100C) was returned to service by procedure and verified, a channel check was completed on the MCR board to verify proper indication. The TS Actions of 3.3.2.d and 3.3.2.i were cleared. ADDITIONAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS Completed interim actions included removing the qualifications of the individuals involved until remediation was conducted; performed a stand down to ensure lessons learned are integrated into the daily work activities and department standards and expectations were reinforced; and supervisors have increased oversight for pre-job briefs and are maintaining field presence to ensure high risk, error likely tasks are briefed adequately, barriers and defenses used and standards and expectations reinforced.",[]

In the event of a postulated fire in the affected areas, both safe shutdown paths on the affected unit could be compromised. Compensatory measures were already in place in accordance with the plant's Fire Hazard Analysis (FHA) as a result of previous conditions involving degraded penetrations in these same fire areas. The presence of the compensatory measures in addition to automatic fire detection in these fire areas ensure that the safe shutdown paths are preserved until the degraded conditions can be corrected. The nonconforming conditions observed for the affected penetrations and fire barriers were identified as affecting both safe shutdown paths for Unit 1. Compensatory measures were already in place in accordance with the plant's Fire Hazard Analysis (FHA) as a result of previous conditions involving degraded barriers in the same fire areas and will remain in place until the fire barriers are repaired. The presence of the compensatory measures in addition to portable fire protection equipment located in adjacent areas ensures the safe shutdown paths are preserved until the degraded conditions are repaired.

"The inspectors identified a Green NCV of Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3. 7.5, ""Component Cooling (CC) System,"" and 3.0.3, because Exelon operated Units 1 and 2 CC systems in an unanalyzed condition on 18 occasions and operated in a condition prohibited by TS on two occasions within the last three years. The inspectors determined that Exelon's operation with both CC loops inoperable and the subsequent failure to place the unit in Mode 5 within 37 hours as required by TS is a performance deficiency. Exelon entered this issue into their corrective action program (CAP) as IR02439913. Exelon's immediate corrective actions included the submission of event notification (EN) 50752 and prohibiting operation of the CC system in a configuration outside of that specified in the TS bases while further analysis was conducted. The inspectors reviewed IMC 0612, Appendix B, ""Issue Screening,"" and determined the issue is more than minor because it is associated with the configuration control attribute of the Mitigating Systems cornerstone and adversely affected the cornerstone objective to ensure the availability, reliability, and capability of systems that respond to initiating events to prevent undesirable consequences. Specifically, the station operated with two CC loops unable to perform their safety function of maintaining component cooling heat exchanger (CCHX) outlet temperatures at or below 120F. In accordance with IMC 0609, Attachment 4, ""Initial Characterization of Findings,"" issued on June 19, 2012, and IMC 0609, Appendix A, ""The Significance Determination Process (SDP) for Findings At-Power,"" Exhibit 2, ""Mitigating Systems Screening Questions,"" issued on June 19, 2012, the inspectors determined that a detailed risk evaluation was necessary to disposition the significance of this finding because the finding represented a loss of a system and/or function. The detailed risk evaluation considered that the deficiency could have, under some ultimate heat sink temperature conditions, resulted in the CCHX outlet temperatures exceeding the design analyzed limit of 120F following the recirculation actuation signal (RAS) during a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The Senior Reactor Analyst performed a bounding significance determination by conservatively assuming a complete loss of safety function for the CCHXs for the applicable limited exposure time. Emergency operating procedures also had contingencies for a postulated loss of the CC function which directed the re-alignment of a containment spray (CS) pump to ensure adequate safety injection is maintained. This evaluation determined the issue was of very low safety significance (Green). The inspectors determined that the finding has a cross-cutting aspect in the area of Human Performance, Design Margins, because Exelon did not operate and maintain equipment within design margins. Specifically, Exelon operated the CC system outside its design safety-related specification, resulting in an operating condition prohibited by TS.",['50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B)']

The emergency preparedness plan requires seismic monitoring instruments to diagnose an earthquake for emergency action levels (EAL) HU6 (Natural or destructive phenomena affecting Protected Area) and HA6 (Natural and destructive phenomena affecting Vital Areas). At 2149 CST on June 26, 2015, the ACS-8003 seismic monitor was declared non-functional due to having a fault light indicated on the C529 seismic cabinet. The ACS-8001 seismic monitor had previously been declared non-functional due to the same condition. With these 2 monitors out of service the seismic alarm capability is not available. ANO procedures provide compensatory measures of using offsite sources to obtain seismic data. The NRC Resident Inspector has been notified. 

* * * UPDATE ON 6/28/15 AT 1552 EDT FROM KENYON MCNEAILL TO DONG PARK * * *
On 6/28/15 at 1232 CDT, batteries have been replaced in ACS-8001 and ACS-8003 seismic monitors. Both monitors have been restored to a fully functional status.

"This IR is being initiated to meet the requirements of LS-AA-1003, ""NRC Inspection Preparation and Response."" Per the procedure, once an NRC inspection report is issued with a Finding, Violation, or Unresolved Issue (URI) the NRC Coordinator is responsible for initiating an IR that requires the responsible organization to review the NRC violation and ensure that the station response and corrective actions properly address the violation. NRC Triennial Fire Protection Inspection Report (2015-007): .6 Circuit Analyses b. Findings Failure to Ensure Circuits Associated with Pressurizer Power Operated Relief Valve Block Valves were Free of Fire Damage Introduction: The inspectors identified a finding of very low safety significance (Green), and an associated Non-Cited Violation (NCV) of the Braidwood Station Operating License for the licensee's failure to ensure that the safe shutdown capability was independent of the fire area and free of fire damage. Specifically, in the event of a fire in the control room, cable spreading rooms, or electrical cable penetration areas the circuits associated with the Pressurizer Power Operated Relief Valve (PORV) block valves, which were relied upon to safely shutdown the plant, may be affected and not available. Description: The pressurizer is equipped with two types of devices for pressure relief, pressurizer safety relief valves and PORVs. The PORVs are direct current (DC) solenoid controlled air operated valves that are controlled to open at a specific set pressure when the pressurizer pressure increases and close when the pressurizer pressure decreases. The PORVs may also be manually operated from the control room. These valves provide the primary overpressure protection of the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) during most modes of operation. Each PORV discharge line has a normally open motor operated block valve immediately upstream of the PORV itself. The block valves are used to isolate the PORVs in case of excessive leakage or a stuck open PORV. Both PORV discharge lines are routed to the pressurizer relief tank (PRT). The PRT is sized to accept and quench the PORV discharge only for a limited time. Certain post-fire scenarios may require or result in a discharge for a longer time. If a PORV were to discharge to the PRT for a sufficiently long time the PRT pressure would rise to the rupture disc relief pressure, and the PRT contents would be released to the containment atmosphere. The licensee identified in the Braidwood Station safe shutdown analysis (SSA) that the PORVs and their associated block valves formed a high-low pressure interface between the RCS and low-pressure systems. A detailed evaluation of the high-low pressure interface of these valves was provided in subsection 2.4.3.2 of the SSA. Section 2.4.3.2 indicated that the Division 12(22) PORV and block valves both had control cables in the main control room and in two of the lower cable spreading rooms. The SSA stated that should a fire in any of these zones cause the spurious opening of the PORVs, coincident with control circuit damage to the block valves, the block valves could still be closed. A ""remote/local"" isolation switch and control switch were provided for the block valves at their motor control center (MCC), located in the Division 12(22) electrical penetration area. The block valves could be closed by placing the ""remote/local"" isolation switch in ""local"" and then closing the valves with the control switch provided. The evaluation also indicated that in fire zones where one of the PORVs had a control cable present in the zone that can spuriously open the PORV and its associated block valve and alternating current (AC) power wasn't available, the PORV could be failed closed by pulling its control power fuse at its DC distribution panel. These actions were depicted in the safe shutdown procedures. Operating Procedure 1(2)Bw0A-PRI-5, ""Control Room Inaccessibility,"" Revision 106 included steps indicating that if any PORV block valve can NOT be closed, THEN locally remove the PORV control power fuses to fail its associated PORV closed. While reviewing the schematic diagrams associated with the pressurizer relief isolation block valves (1/2RY8000A and 1/2RY8000B) the inspectors identified a circuit deficiency for which a design basis fire in either the main control room, cable spreading rooms (lower and upper), or electrical cable penetration areas could prevent the Pressurizer PORV block valves from being closed from the local control switches at their associated MCCs. The inspectors identified that a potential fire induced ground in any of these fire areas could clear/open the associated control power fuses (the normal and alternate), which would prevent the valves from operating at the local or remote control switches. The licensee, in response to the inspectors' identification of the circuit deficiency, initially determined that the existing SSA and procedures included mitigating actions if such a condition occurred. The actions included steps to locally remove the PORV control power fuse to fail its associated PORV closed. The inspectors were concerned that because the PORVs and their associated block valves formed a high-low pressure interface that required postulating a proper polarity cable to cable fault, these actions may not be effective in preventing the PORVs from spuriously opening or ensuring closing them during a design basis fire in any of these areas. The inspectors concluded that the licensee's credited actions to remove the control power fuses to close the PORVs did not meet their design and licensing basis for the PORVs and their associated block valves for high-low pressure interface components as specified in the SSA Section 2.4.1.5.2, ""Cable Damage Assumption,"" which stated, in part, that for components which do form part of a high-low pressure interface between the RCS and a lower pressure system, credible circuit failures include multiple open circuits, short circuits, shorts to ground, and multiple hot shorts within the control circuit. In addition, the SSA stated 3-phase AC power circuit cable-to-cable proper phase sequence faults and 2-wire ungrounded DC circuit cable-to-cable proper polarity faults are considered to be credible, and must be evaluated. Upon discovery, the licensee entered this issue into their Corrective Action Program (CAP) as Action Request (AR) 02542045, AR 02544447, and AR 2550306 and established fire watches as immediate compensatory actions. In order to resolve this issue the licensee intended to perform plant modifications. On September 2, the licensee updated the previous notification adding that the local actions to close the block valves at the MCC may not be effective because the MCC may not have electrical power during the design basis fire and therefore, the credited safe shutdown action to remove the PORV control power fuses may not prevent the PORV from spuriously opening and may not ensure the closing of the PORV during a design basis fire in the cable spreading rooms. Analysis: The inspectors determined that the licensee's failure to ensure that the shutdown capability was independent of the fire area and free of fire damage was contrary to Braidwood Station Operating License conditions for the Fire Protection Program and was a performance deficiency. Specifically, in the event of a design basis fire in the control room, cable spreading rooms, or electrical cable penetration areas the licensee failed to ensure that the shutdown capability for Pressurizer PORV block valves would not be affected by fire damage that could impair the operation and closing of the valves from the local control switches located at their associated MCCs in the event of spurious operation of their associated PORVs. The performance deficiency was determined to be more than minor because it was associated with the Mitigating Systems Cornerstone attribute of Protection Against External Events (Fire), and affected the cornerstone objective of ensuring the availability, reliability, and capability of systems that respond to initiating events to prevent undesirable consequences (i.e., core damage). Specifically, in the event of a fire in the control room or the upper and lower cable spreading rooms, fire-induced circuit failures could result in spurious operation of the Pressurizer PORVs and impair the operation and the closing of their associated block valves thus affecting and complicating the plant shutdown in the event of a fire in any of these areas. The actions to close the block valve were required in the event of spurious opening of the associated PORV because the action to remove the control power fuse was not consistent with the circuit analysis for high-low pressure interface component and may not prevent the PORV from spuriously opening and did not ensure the closing of the PORV. In accordance with Inspection Manual Chapter (IMC) 0609, ""Significance Determination Process,"" Attachment 0609.04, ""Initial Characterization of Findings,"" Table 2 the inspectors determined the finding affected the Mitigating Systems Cornerstone. The finding degraded fire protection defense-in-depth strategies, and the inspectors determined, using Table 3, that it could be evaluated using Appendix F, ""Fire Protection Significance Determination Process."" Using IMC 0609, Appendix F, Attachment 1, ""Fire Protection Significance Determination Process Worksheet,"" the inspectors were not able to screen out the finding using the data available to them, therefore a detailed risk-evaluation was performed by a Region III Senior Reactor Analyst (SRA). The inspectors assigned the finding to the category of ""Post-Fire Safe Shutdown."" In Task 1.4.5, ""Post-fire Safe Shutdown,"" the inspectors answered ""Yes"" to Question C, ""Could the fire result in a piece of equipment required for safe shutdown not being available."" The inspectors contacted the Region III SRA for assistance with the risk evaluation. The change in core damage frequency (?CDF) risk for this deficiency is represented by core damage sequences that include the potential for spurious operation of a pressurizer PORV following certain fires in the main control room, cable spreading rooms, and electrical cable penetration areas that also fail the ability to operate the associated PORV block valve. The ?CDF values in this analysis apply to both Unit 1 and Unit 2 and the total ?CDF applies to each unit separately. Main Control Room The ?CDF for the main control room was evaluated in two cases. The first case is when evacuation is not required. The second case is when evacuation is required. Each case is discussed below. Case1: Evacuation Not Required The frequency of fire for the main control room cabinet (Cabinet 1PM05J) that contained the pressurizer block valves and PORVs was 2.29E-05/yr as listed in the Braidwood Individual Plant Examination of External Events (IPEEE). To estimate the spurious actuation likelihood of the PORVs, the SRA used NUREG/CR-7150, ""Joint Assessment of Cable Damage and Quantification of Effects from Fire,"" Volume 2, Table 8-1, ""Summary of Mean Conditional Probability of Spurious Operation for Single Break Control Circuits."" The spurious actuation likelihood given inter-cable shorts with thermoset cables was listed as 6.3E-03. The likelihood of a proper polarity hot short then is (6.3E-03)2 or 4.0E-05. Since there are two PORVs, the likelihood of a proper polarity hot short for either PORV is 8.0E-05. In addition, spurious action likelihood given an inter-cable (6.3E-03) and a ground fault equivalent (0.17) hot short was calculated to be 1.1E-03 (6.3E-03 x 0.17). Since there are two PORVs, the hot short probability for this particular failure mode for either PORV is 2.2E-03. Thus, the overall probability of fire-induced spurious operation to open of either pressurizer PORV due to all possible failure modes was calculated to be 2.3E-03. For the conditional core damage probability (CCDP), using the Braidwood Standardized Plant Analysis Risk model, Version 8.24, and ""Systems Analysis Programs for Hands-on Integrated Reliability Evaluations"" Version 8.1.2. The SRA performed an initiating event assessment assuming a small break loss of coolant accident as a result of the block/PORV valves being open. In addition, the SRA assumed one division of electrical equipment was rendered unavailable due to fire. The result was a CCDP of 2.46E-02. Using the above data and assumptions, the main control room fire risk contribution for Case 1 is 1.30E-09/yr:
?CDF Case 1 = (2.29E-05/yr) * (2.3E-03) * (2.46E-02) = 1.30E-09/yr Case 2: Evacuation Required The frequency of fire for the main control room was again assumed to be 2.29E-05/yr. The fire is assumed to result in abandonment of the main control room given suppression attempts fail at 15-minutes. Table 5-2 of NUREG-2169, ""Nuclear Power Plant Fire Ignition Frequency and Non-Suppression Probability Estimation Using the Updated Fire Events Database: United States Fire Event Experience Through 2009,"" lists the 15-minute non-suppression probability as 8.0E-03. As stated in Case 1, the probability of fire-induced spurious operation to open of either pressurizer PORV is 2.3E-03. For the CCDP, the SRA used a single overall human error probability of 0.1 as a screening CCDP surrogate. Using the above data and assumptions, the main control room fire risk contribution for Case 2 is negligible: ?CDF Case 2 = (2.29E-05/yr) * (8.0E-03) * (2.3E-03) * (1.0E-01) = 4.21E-11/yr The total ?CDF for the main control room is estimated as the sum of the two cases, or a ?CDF value of 1.34E-09/yr. Cable Spreading Rooms The SRA estimated the frequency of fire in the two upper and two lower cable spreading rooms as 1.4E-03/yr using Table A1.3 of IMC 0609 Attachment 1, ""Fire Frequency Evaluation Worksheet."" This value is conservative as it assumes that the cable spreading rooms contain nonqualified cables with high loading. Fires in the cable spreading rooms are not assumed to result in control room abandonment. The upper cable spreading room uses an automatic halon suppression system. NUREG/CR-6850, ""Fire PRA Methodology for Nuclear Power Facilities,"" lists the 11 non-suppression probability for automatic halon systems as 0.05. The lower cable spreading room uses an automatic CO2 suppression system. The NUREG lists the non-suppression probability for automatic CO2 systems as 0.04. The SRA used the higher non-suppression probability of 5E-02 for fires in the upper and lower cable spreading rooms. As stated in Case 1 above, the probability of fire-induced spurious operation to open of either pressurizer PORV is 2.3E-03. For the CCDP, the SRA used the 2.46E-02 value assuming a small break loss of coolant accident. Using the above data and assumptions, the ?CDF for the cable spreading room fire for both the upper and lower rooms' contribution to the risk of this issue is estimated at 1.58E-8/yr: ?CDF cable spreading rooms = (4 rooms) * (1.4E-03/yr) * (5.0E-02) * (2.3E-03) * (2.46E-02) = 1.58E-8/yr Division 11(21) Electrical Penetration Area The SRA estimated the frequency of fire in the Division 11(21) Electrical Penetration Area as 1.4E-03/yr using Table A1.3 of IMC 0609 Attachment 1, ""Fire Frequency Evaluation Worksheet."" This value is conservative as it assumes that the electrical penetration areas contain nonqualified cables with high loading. Fires in the Division 11(21) Electrical Penetration Area are not assumed to result in control room abandonment. The Division 11(21) Electrical Penetration Area has no automatic fire suppression, although there is detection, and the area is accessible to the fire brigade. Table 5-2 of NUREG-2169 lists the 15-minute non-suppression probability for cable fires as 0.126. As stated in Case 1 above, the probability of fire-induced spurious operation to open of either pressurizer PORV is 2.3E-03. For the CCDP, the SRA assumed only random failures of equipment, and calculated a value of 5.49E-03 assuming a small break loss of coolant accident. Using the above data and assumptions, the ?CDF for the Division 11(21) Electrical Penetration Area fire contributions to the risk of this issue is estimated at 2.2E-09/yr: ?CDF Division 11(21) Electrical Penetration Area = (1.4E-03/yr) * (0.126) * (2.3E-03) * (5.49E-3) = 2.2E-09/yr Division 21(22) Electrical Penetration Area The ?CDF for the Division 21(22) Electrical Penetration Area was estimated assuming the areas are symmetrical and the same data and assumptions applied as for the Division 11(21) Electrical Penetration Area. The ?CDF for the Division 21(22) Electrical Penetration Area fire contributions to the risk of this issue is estimated at 2.2E-09/yr. Total ?CDF The total ?CDF due to this performance deficiency is estimated as the sum of the individual ?CDF values, or 2.2E-08/yr. The dominant core damage sequences involved small break loss of coolant accident scenarios. Based on the detailed risk evaluation, the SRA determined that the finding was of very low risk significance (Green). The inspectors did not identify a cross-cutting aspect associated with this finding, because the finding was not representative of the licensee's current performance. The last opportunity for the licensee to identify and evaluate this issue was during the Multiple Spurious Operations (MSOs) project in 2012. However, it was outside the scope of the MSO project to look at the detailed wiring configuration for the PORVs and their associated block valves because the scenario of spurious operation of the PORVs and its mitigating strategy was thought to be previously very well thought out. Enforcement: License Conditions 2.E of the Braidwood Station operating licenses, for Units 1 and 2, required, in part, that the licensee implement and maintain in effect all provisions of the fire protection program as described in the Final Safety Analysis Report, as supplemented and amended, and as approved in Safety Evaluation Reports and their supplements. Section 2.4.3.2, ""Pressurizer PORVs and Block Valves"" of the SSA, stated, in part, that the Division 12(22) PORV and block valves both have control cables in the main control room and in two of the lower cable spreading rooms. Should a fire in any of these zones cause the spurious opening of the PORV, coincident with control circuit damage to the block valve, the block valve could still be closed. A ""remote/local"" isolation switch and control switch are provided for the block valve at its",[]

"This issue reports an NRC Severity Level IV NCV for failing to report when both divisions of RT differential flow instruments were placed in bypass, which rendered the instruments inoperable and resulted in a loss of the isolation function. This issue is also discussed in IR 2645140 (3D Classification with a Work Group Evaluation) and IR 2652522 (2B Classification with ACE). LS-AA-1003 requires that the responsible organization reviews the NRC issues and ensures the station response and corrective actions properly address the violation and the crosscutting aspect.

Introduction: The Inspectors identified a Severity Level IV NCV for failing to report an event or condition, that at the time of discovery could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function, to the NRC within eight hours. Specifically, control room operators placed both divisions of RT differential flow instruments in bypass, which rendered the instruments inoperable and resulted in a loss of the isolation function.

Description: On January 25, 2016, control room personnel placed the RT 'A' filter demineralizer in hold for backwash and pre-coat per Station Procedure CPS 3303.01, ""Reactor Water Cleanup,"" Section 8.1.3, and Station Procedure CPS 3302.02, ""Reactor Water Cleanup Filter Demineralizer 'A' Operating Procedure,"" Sections 8.2 and 8.5. While placing the RT 'A' filter demineralizer back into service per Station Procedure CPS 3302.02, Section 8.6, the control room received an RT differential flow alarm. The control room operators placed both divisions of RT differential flow instruments in bypass per Station Procedure CPS 3303.01, which rendered the instruments inoperable and resulted in a loss of the isolation function. The licensee entered TS 3.3.6.1, action D.1, which stated to place channel in trip in 24 hours and action E.1, which stated to restore RT isolation capability in 1 hour. The procedure section to place the RT 'A' filter demineralizer in service was completed and the control room operators placed both divisions of RT differential flow instruments in normal, performed a channel check, and exited TS 3.3.6.1, actions D.1 and E.1. The operations logs documented that the licensee reviewed NRC's guidance for reporting events, NUREG.1022, Section 3.2.7, ""Event or Condition that Could Have Prevented Fulfillment of a Safety Function."" The operators determined that the condition was not reportable to the NRC based on the statement that ""reports are not required when systems are declared inoperable as part of a planned evolution for maintenance or surveillance testing when done in accordance with an approved procedure and the plant's TS (unless a condition is discovered that would have resulted in the system being declared inoperable)."" After reviewing the logs on the following day the inspectors asked the control room operators why the activity was considered a planned evolution for maintenance and not considered routine operation of the RT system. The licensee did not provide information to support the activity was a maintenance activity, so the inspectors reviewed the requirements and determined that the condition was reportable. The licensee documented the issue in their CAP as AR 02652522 and created an action to submit a licensee event report (LER). The inspectors' review focused on the reportability aspect of placing the RT differential flow switches in bypass. The inspectors have not reviewed the technical justification or analyses associated with putting the differential flow switches in bypass while the system is in operation, therefore, they have not determined whether this action is in compliance with regulatory requirements. The inspectors planned to review the technical justification and analyses following the receipt of the licensee's LER.

Analysis: The inspectors determined that the failure to report an event or condition, that at the time of discovery could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function, to the NRC within eight hours was a performance deficiency. Specifically, the licensee failed to notify the NRC after placing both divisions of RT differential flow instrumentation in bypass, which rendered the instruments inoperable and resulted in a loss of the isolation function. The inspectors reviewed this issue in accordance with IMC 0612 and the Enforcement Manual. Violations are dispositioned using the traditional enforcement process because they are considered to be violations that potentially impede or impact the regulatory process. The inspectors reviewed the NRC Enforcement Policy and determined this violation was a Severity Level IV violation because the licensee's failure to make the report did not cause the NRC to reconsider a regulatory position or undertake substantial further inquiry. No cross-cutting aspect was assigned because cross-cutting aspects are not assigned to traditional enforcement only violations.

Enforcement: Requirements in part, state that the licensee report within eight hours any event or condition, that at the time of discovery, could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function needed to mitigate the consequence of an accident. Contrary to the above, on January 25, 2016, the licensee failed to report, within eight hours, a condition that, at the time of discovery, could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function needed to mitigate the consequence of an accident. Specifically, control room personnel placed both divisions of RT differential flow instrumentation in bypass, which rendered the instruments inoperable and resulted in a loss of the isolation function needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. In accordance with the Enforcement Policy, the violation was classified as a Severity Level IV violation. Because this violation was of very low safety significance, was not repetitive or willful, and was entered into the licensee's CAP as AR 02652522, it is being treated as an NCV. Corrective actions included creating an action to submit an LER.",[]

On 7-18-16 at 14:50 hrs the weekly ERO notification test for Quad Cities station failed. At 16:00 hrs the site EPM performed an announced ERO Call-in Drill to determine the extent of the Everbridge failure. At that point it was determined that the entire Everbridge ERO Notification System was not working. The ERO was notified at 15:42 hrs that a possible issue with notification was occurring and to stand-by for additional testing.

"This IR documents a historical condition that was identified during time line development for the reportable condition associated with IR 3955705 (HV-011-015A ESW Return FSSD issue). During the time period of January 17, 2016 and April 8, 2016 a blank flange was installed by ECR LG14-00193 at flow element FE-011-011B to allow installation of a new manual valve 011-0125B in series with valve HV-011-011B. With this blank flange installed, only one of the two credited ""B"" loop ESW return paths to the spray pond was available. The blank flange was removed during 1R16 after completion of scheduled RHRSW piping maintenance and installation of new manual valve 011-0125B. This is analogous to the condition identified in IR 3955705 which also had one of the two credited ESW loop return paths to the spray pond unavailable. The existing fire safe shutdown analysis (FSSD) credits both return paths in order to mitigate certain single spurious fire induced valve operations. IR 3955705 identified a non-compliant FSSD condition with the ""A"" ESW return loop. This IR is identifying a historical non-compliant FSSD unanalyzed condition on the ""B"" ESW return loop. FSSD Impact: A contract was issued to have the Limerick FSSD SME review this historical condition. This review identified that the three fire area analyses were impacted by the blank flange installed by ECR LG14-00193. The three impacted fire areas are 16, 45E and 82. The historical impact of ECR LG14-00193 to these fire areas is as follows: Fire Area 016 . Some credited B/D train safe shutdown equipment would no longer be available, however sufficient redundant equipment remained available to meet the FSSD regulatory requirements. No additional manual actions required to compensate for the additional failures. Fire Area 082 . Some credited B/D train safe shutdown equipment would no longer be available, however sufficient redundant equipment remained available to meet the FSSD regulatory requirements. No additional manual actions required to compensate for the additional failures. Fire Area 045E . NO credited safe shutdown method remain available. This review identified that fire area 45E (Eastern Half of Limerick Unit 1 Reactor Enclosure Elevation 253'-0"") was not in compliance with the existing FSSD analysis while the blank flange was installed. The review results for the impacted areas were also confirmed by Site Engineering personnel. ECR LG14-00193 and its associated screening did not identify and address that fire area 45E would not be compliant with the existing analysis documented in UFSAR chapter 9A (FPER). The FSSD analysis credits both return flow paths so that Emergency Service Water can be returned to the spray pond while remaining tolerant to certain spurious valve operations. For fire area 45E, with only one of the two return flow paths available, a single spurious fire induced closure of valve HV-011-015B can result in deadheading of a B loop ESW pump. This will cause a loss of cooling water to the credited B RHR pump compartment room coolers and the credited RHR pump motor oil cooler. Fire Area 45E credits Fire Safe Shutdown Method C. If the credited B RHR pump fails due to loss of compartment cooling and motor oil cooling caused by the single spurious fire induced closure of HV-011-015B, it will prevent ""B"" LPCI injection which is credited for RPV inventory control at approximately 20 to 25 minutes into the post fire event. This could result in the only credited safe shutdown method (C) being unavailable. The plant would not have been able to achieve safe shutdown, because the single credited safe shutdown method could have been lost. This historical issue may be reportable. It can result in a noncompliance with current fire safe shutdown analysis documented in the fire protection evaluation report and fire protection program which is the current Limerick licensing basis (CLB). The current Limerick licensing basis assumes a single spurious actuation of safe shutdown components during any single deterministic fire event for plant areas as documented in Limerick UFSAR FPER section 9A. 5. The identified historical issue results in a single spurious actuation that can impact the ability to safely shutdown. With the loss of the single credited safe shutdown method during the postulated area wide fire in fire area 45E, the plant could not have been able to achieve safe shutdown. This condition is therefore unanalyzed.",[]

"An issue was identified at Oyster Creek related to EAL E-HU1, Damage to a loaded cask CONFINEMENT BOUNDARY documented under IR 4003001. Byron Station reviewed ISFSI cask documentation certificates of compliance for all dry casks loaded at the site. It was identified that all dry cask containers are identical however they were loaded under different certificates of compliance. The variations between these certificates included different limit values for the measured dose rates on a loaded OVERPACK. The first six casks at Byron were loaded under certificate of compliance No. 1014 revision 3 which contained limit values for the measure dose rates on a loaded OVERPACK of > 20 mr/hr (gamma + neutron) on the top of the spent fuel cask or > 110mr/hr (gamma + neutron) on the side of the spent fuel cask, excluding inlet and outlet ducts. Whereas the remainder of the casks were loaded under certificate of compliance No. 1014 revision 7 and 9 revision 1. These certificates contained limit values for the measure dose rates on a loaded OVERPACK of > 30 mr/hr (gamma + neutron) on the top of the spent fuel cask or > 300 mr/hr (gamma + neutron) on the side of the spent fuel cask, excluding inlet and outlet ducts. It was identified that the current EAL action level in EP-AA-1002 Addendum 3, Emergency Action Levels for Byron Station, Revision 1 UE EAL E-HU1 is based on the certificate of compliance No. 1014 Revision 9 revision 1. (limit values for the measure dose rates on a loaded OVERPACK of > 30 mr/hr (gamma + neutron) on the top of the spent fuel cask or > 300 mr/hr (gamma + neutron) on the side of the spent fuel cask, excluding inlet and outlet ducts) NEI 99-01 requires that the UE EAL is 2 times the TS initial loading limit.

PB Station Engineering reviewed ISFSI cask documentation certificates of compliance for all dry casks loaded at the site. It was identified that all dry cask containers are essentially the same; however, they were loaded under two different certificates of compliance amendments. The variations between these amendments included different limit values for the measured dose rates. There exists three casks (45, 46 and 47) at PB loaded under Certificate of Compliance (C of C) 1027 / Technical Specification Amendment 0; with the remaining 77 casks have been analyzed to be in compliance with C of C 1027 / Technical Specification Amendment 1. It was identified that the current EAL threshold values listed in EP-AA-1007 Addendum 3, Emergency Action Levels for Peach Bottom Station, Revision 4, UE EAL E-HU1 are based on the certificate of compliance 1027 Technical Specification Amendment 1 TS 5.2.3.3 limits assuming design basis fuel is loaded in the casks. These values are different than the certificate of compliance 1027, Technical Specification Amendment 0 values of measured dose rates. Additionally, most loaded TN casks assume cask specific lower limiting dose rates as in accordance with TS 5.2.3.2, not TS 5.2.3.3. For amendment 0 casks (45, 46, 47), the TS dose limits are about 2/3 of what they are for amendment 1 casks (of which the EAL is based on). Also, the TS 5.2.3.2 cask specific dose rates (of which is credited in the PBAPS analysis) are also substantially lower limits than the TS 5.2.3.3 dose rates for design basis fuel (which PBAPS does not credit for all loaded casks). It appears that by calculating the PBAPS EAL as twice the values of the TS 5.2.3.3, this would make the EAL threshold artificially high.

"An issue was identified at Oyster Creek related to EAL E-HU1, ""Damage to a loaded cask CONFINEMENT BOUNDARY,"" as documented under IR 4003001, where Oyster had two types of DCS canisters on the pad and the EAL was based on the limits for only one type. As a result, Quad Cities reviewed ISFSI dry cask storage (DCS) Certificate of Compliance (CoC) documentation for all DCS containers placed on the ISFSI pad. It was identified that all DCS containers are of the same type; however, they were loaded under different CoC Amendments/Revisions. The variations between these CoC Amendments/Revisions includes different maximum dose rate limits for the measured dose rates on a loaded OVERPACK as specified in DCS Technical Specification (TS) 5.7.4. The first 37 casks at Quad Cities were loaded under CoC No. 1014 Amendment Nos. 2 and 3. The associated DCS TS 5.7.4 for these Amendments states that the measured dose rates on a loaded OVERPACK shall not exceed the following values: a. 20 mr/hr (gamma + neutron) on the top of the OVERPACK b. 110 mr/hr (gamma + neutron) on the side of the OVERPACK, excluding inlet and outlet ducts. The last 11 casks loaded on the ISFSI at Quad Cities meet the requirements of CoC No. 1014 Amendment No. 8, Revision No. 1. The associated DCS TS 3.7.4 states that the measured dose rates on a loaded OVERPACK shall not exceed the following values: a. 30 mr/hr (gamma + neutron) on the top of the OVERPACK b. 300 mr/hr (gamma + neutron) on the side of the OVERPACK, excluding inlet and outlet ducts. It was identified that the current EAL action level in EP-AA-1006 Addendum 3, ""Emergency Action Levels for Quad Cities Station,"" Revision 3, for UE EAL E-HU1 is based on the limits from CoC No. 1014 Amendment No. 2 and 3, i.e., 40 mr/hr (gamma + neutron) on the top of the OVERPACK and 220 mr/hr (gamma + neutron) on the side of the OVERPACK, excluding inlet and outlet ducts. The current EALs are based on NEI 99-01, ""Development of Emergency Action Levels for Non-Passive Reactors,"" Revision 6. As described in NEI 99-01, Revision 6, the basis for this UE EAL threshold is ""2 times the site-specific cask specific technical specification allowable radiation level."" Furthermore, NEI 99-01, Revision 6 states that emphasis for this classification is the degradation in the level of safety of the spent fuel cask and not the magnitude of the associated dose or dose rate. At issue is the magnitude of the dose rate at the cask at which the site will declare an unusual event; there are no potential escalation paths for this EAL. When a HI-STORM is loaded onto the ISFSI pad, the TS limit is verified per RP-QC-304. While the procedure was updated to reflect the higher TS limits as discussed above, this procedure also verifies the dose rate is lower than an administrative limit (25 mr/hr for the side and 8.5 mr/hr for the top) that ensures that the fuel loaded onto the ISFSI had a baseline dose rate that was significantly less than the dose rate limits of the amendments used to establish the EAL. The DCS work orders for the eleven casks loaded to Amendment 8 Revision 1 (WPs 01614866 and 01805377) were reviewed and the maximum dose rates measured per RP-QC-304 were 1.7 mr/hr on the side and 1.3 mr/hr on the top. The fact that the casks loaded on the ISFSI pad at Quad Cities Station comply with different CoC Amendments/Revisions and have different DCS TS 5.7.4 limits was not recognized when the EALs were revised to meet NEI 99-01, Revision 6. The need to specify different EAL thresholds associated with the different CoC Amendments/Revisions is being questioned. Since the baseline dose rates of the casks are significantly lower than the dose rates used to establish the current EAL at Quad Cities, the use of the current EAL is appropriate while this issue is investigated further.",['50.72(b)(3)(xiii)']

This condition could be the result of a postulated Main Steam Line Break with a loss of offsite power. ""During a natural circulation cooldown with a faulted steam generator, flow in the stagnant reactor coolant system (RCS) loop associated with the isolated faulted steam generator (SG) could stagnate and result in elevated temperatures in that loop. This becomes an issue when RCS depressurization to residual heat removal system (RHR) entry conditions is attempted. The liquid in the stagnant loop will flash to steam and prevent RCS depressurization. In this condition, the time required to complete the cooldown would be sufficiently long that the nitrogen accumulators associated with Callaway's atmospheric steam dumps and turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pump flow control valves would be exhausted. The atmospheric steam dumps and turbine driven auxiliary feedwater pump would not be capable of performing their specified safety functions of cooling the plant to entry conditions for RHR operation. This issue has been analyzed by Westinghouse in WCAP-16632-P. This WCAP determined that to prevent loop stagnation, the RCS cooldown rate in these conditions should be limited to a rate dependent on the temperature differential present in the active loops. ""The WCAP analysis was used to support a revision to the generic Emergency Response Guideline (ERG) for ES-0.2 ""Natural Circulation Cooldown."" Figure 1 in ES-0.2 provides a curve of the maximum allowable cooldown rate as a function of active loop temperature differential which is directly proportional to the level of core decay heat. At the time of discovery of this condition, Callaway's EOP structure did not ensure that the ES-0.2 guidance would be implemented for a natural circulation cooldown with a stagnant loop. ""Callaway has issued interim guidance to the on-shift personnel regarding this concern and is in the process of revising the applicable EOPs. ""This condition is reportable for any event or condition that at the time of discovery could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to (A) Shutdown the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition, (B) Remove residual heat, or (D) mitigate the consequences of an accident.""","['50.72(b)(3)(v)(A)', '50.72(b)(3)(v)(B)', '50.72(b)(3)(v)(D)']"

Fire Protection Program Chapter 6.2, ""Analysis of High/Low Pressure Interfaces,"" requires Exelon to address the situations for which the isolation valves at a given interface point consists of two electrically controlled valves in series and where the potential may exist for a single fire to cause damage to cables associated with both valves. Contrary to above, as of March 14, 2018, Exelon identified they failed to evaluate two motor-operated valves in series, MO-2-06-2663 and MO-2-06-038B for Unit 2, and MO-3-06-3663 and MO-3-06-038B for Unit 3, where the potential may exist for a single fire to cause damage to cables associated with both valves. Specifically, a postulated fire scenario could cause spurious opening of the valves, which may potentially result in a fire-induced loss of coolant accident through the high/low pressure system interface. Exelon's evaluation identified the affected valves' cables are routed through Fire Area 6N for the Unit 2 valves, and Fire Area 13N for the Unit 3 valves, and thus, a possibility exists for a single fire to cause damage to cables associated with both valves.

"Problem Description

POSTULATED HOT SHORT FIRE EVENT THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT SAFE SHUTDOWN EQUIPMENT.

Condition Description: A review of industry Operating Experience identified that there were unprotected DC control circuits for nonsafety-related DC motors which are routed from the Battery Charger Rooms to other separate fire areas. Circuit Breakers used to protect the motor power conductors appear to be inadequate to protect the control conductors. The concern is that under fire safe shutdown conditions, it is postulated that a fire in one area can cause short circuits potentially resulting in secondary fires or cable failures in other fire areas where the cables are routed. The secondary fires or cable failures are outside the assumptions of the Safe Shutdown Analysis.

TRM Actions are being implemented as necessary. While reviewing AR 01581135 ""OPEX RVW OF EVENT 49490 NEEDED FOR SOUTH TEXAS HOT SHORT"" Electrical Design determined that the control circuit #12AWG cable for the Turbine Generator Emergency Bearing Lube Oil (EBOB) 94P-2 pump is unfused, and would not be protected by the motor circuit breaker with a trip setting of 250 amps. This condition also exists for the Emergency Seal Oil Pump (ESOP) 94P-13 (125A Circuit breaker) and RFPT DC Emergency Oil Pumps 31P-7A & 31P-7B (100A CB breaker.) Nonsafety-related control cables for these pumps are routed in safety-related trays with safety-related cables thru Fire Zones BR-4, BR-5, CS-1, RR-1, and CR-1. JAF identified a similar issue during the initial review of a different OE several years ago and resolved it by installing fuses on the 125VDC Station Batteries Ammeter lines.

"Exelon Generation was informed by the Replacement Steam Generator (RSG) supplier BWXT that certain small secondary-side nozzles on the replacement steam generators at Byron and Braidwood may not be in full compliance with the ASME Code of construction. BWXT documented the potential ASME Code nonconformance in a letter to Exelon outlining the nature of the nonconformance and the BWXT evaluation of the nonconformance. The BWXT letter contains an evaluation demonstrating this condition does not represent a substantial safety hazard (a loss of safety function to the extent that there is a major reduction in the degree of protection provided to public health and safety for any facility or activity licensed or otherwise approved or regulated by the NRC). Exelon has reviewed the BWXT assessment and concurs this issue does not pose a substantial safety hazard. This Issue Report was written to initiate actions necessary for notification and resolution of the ASME Code of Construction nonconformance on the Byron and Braidwood Unit 1 replacement steam generator affected secondary side nozzles. BWXT Canada (Cambridge, Ontario) (formally Babcock & Wilcox Canada) was in the process of manufacturing a replacement steam generator for another utility when it was discovered that the process procedures for removing surface indications on the small nozzles following final machining did not document the depth of excavation required to eliminate the indication. Specifically, during Engineering review of a replacement steam generator currently in production at BWXT's Cambridge facility, it was discovered that volumetric-NDE of the weld repair (as required by ASME Code Section III NB-4453.4 when the excavation exceeds the lesser of 10% of the section thickness or 3/8"") was missed on a small-nozzle weld repair, contrary to the ASME Section III Div 1 Class 1 Code requirement. The small nozzle in question is fabricated by weld metal buildup as permitted by NB-4244(c). An extent-of- condition evaluation was initiated to identify the list of potential projects, with priority on components in operating nuclear plants. Upon completion of the extent-of-condition for items supplied to Exelon, it was determined that replacement steam generators installed in Byron Unit 1 (BWXT Contract 7720) and Braidwood Unit 1 (BWXT Contract 7735) are affected. The affected nozzles by Replacement Steam Generator (RSG) serial numbers are (refer to assembly drawing 7720E001, 7720E214 and 7720D105, et. al. for details): Byron Station RSG's 7720-02 . Recirculation nozzle W18 7720-03 . Blowdown nozzles (2) W32, W33 7720-04 . Recirculation nozzle W18 and Blowdown nozzles (2) W32, W33 Braidwood Station RSG's 7735-01 . Recirculation nozzle W18 7735-03 . Recirculation nozzle W18 and Blowdown nozzles (2) W32, W33 7735-04 . Recirculation nozzle W18 All of the affected nozzles are 3-inch nozzles manufactured by depositing weld metal on the outer surface of the RSG shell. After the weld deposit is completed, a volumetric examination of the deposit was completed, per ASME Code, on all nozzles to verify no unacceptable defects within the body of the deposit. After completion of the volumetric examination, the weld deposit is machined to the required dimensional specifications and the penetration is bored through the weld deposit and RSG shell (the blowdown ports are bored into the RSG tubesheet). After machining, BWXT performs surface examinations for defects as required by ASME Code. All unacceptable indications are repairs through defect removal and weld repair. Surface non-destructive examinations a (NDE) are performed to verify elimination of unacceptable indications. This was completed successfully by BWXT. The ASME Code for Section III Class 1 components (NB-4453.4) states when excavation to eliminate surface indications exceeds a specified depth, the original NDE requirements (volumetric examination) must be applied to the repaired component. BWXT has determined that the above identified nozzles did require repair of surface indications and the documented records do not indicate the depth of the excavations and no post-repair volumetric examinations were performed. The lack of documentation related to surface excavation depth means full compliance with ASME Code Section III Class 1 NB-4453.4 is indeterminant as BWXT cannot confirm if a post-repair volumetric examination was required. This is the ASME Code nonconformance. After completion of the nozzle fabrication, the appropriate Code-required post weld heat treatments, post-heat treatment surface NDE, hydro testing and post-test surface NDE was completed successfully. There were no other issues identified with any of the potentially affected nozzles. This subsequent testing and inspections provide confidence in the integrity of the manufactured nozzles. Furthermore, BWXT calculation 222-7720-B54 completed at the time of RSG delivery to Exelon shows the 3-inch nozzles are lightly loaded (deadweight, thermal, OBE) with significant margin to stress limits and no reinforcement at the shell or tubesheet is required. BWXT in their evaluation states: ""In all cases where weld buildup has been used by BWXT Canada (and prior when the Company was B&W Canada), nozzles are exempt from reinforcement in accordance with NB-3332.1. That is, the weld metal buildup is not required to structurally reinforce the vessel wall. The weld metal buildups were fabricated in compliance with NB-4244(c), which is a provision for using weld metal to reinforce openings in vessels. This is a conservative approach since the vessel wall does not require reinforcement because the nozzle openings are small (meeting the ""small"" criteria of NB-3332.1). In all cases, the affected small nozzles are located on the secondary side of steam generators, where the thermal transients are relatively benign and piping loads are modest (or negligible, meeting the Code criteria of ""substantially no piping loads"")."" For clarification of the above BWXT comment, the blowdown nozzles are actually installed on the tubesheet, the boundary between the primary and secondary side of the RSG. ASME Code nonconformances may be resolved by taking actions to achieve compliance (volumetric exams are not easily done after RSG installation) or through NRC Relief. The BWXT letter provides a potential alternative means of resolution of this issue. BWXT indicated the Exelon purchase specification required the RSGs to be constructed in accordance with ASME Section III, Class 1 requirements of the 1986 Edition. The small nozzles in question are classified as part of the vessel in the Certified Design Specification; however, there may be opportunities for Exelon to reassess the classification of the affected nozzles and eliminate the need for post-surface repair volumetric NDE. This Issue Report will create the necessary actions to review available paths to resolution. In accordance with NB-5243(c), full penetration corner welded branch and piping connections less than NPS 4 only require surface examination, not volumetric examination (all of the small nozzles are less than NPS 4). With that in mind, a weld repair in a previously volumetrically examined weld-metal-buildup small-nozzle is analogous to a butt-weld in a branch piping connection to the component . actually bounded by the branch piping connection, since it is unlikely any small-nozzle weld-repair would have extended around the full-circumference like a butt-weld; recognizing that in the limit, they are essentially the same. A weld-buildup small-nozzle on a steam generator where a weld repair did not receive volumetric examination (only surface examination) is at no more risk of failure than branch connections less than NPS 4 elsewhere in the plant. The Exelon review of potential resolution actions should include a consideration of design specification revisions to potentially eliminate the current nonconformance. The consequences of failure in a basic component as a result of the condition would not result in a substantial safety hazard. Failure of a small nozzle would result in a small opening in the pressure boundary; most probable as a small leak, but in the limit postulated as a guillotine rupture of the nozzle; recognizing that there is no reasonable mechanistic means of that happening (the material is ductile, not highly cyclically loaded, modest or negligible piping loads, previously volumetrically examined prior to repair, surface examined after repair, etc.). The pressure boundary is adequately structurally reinforced without the nozzle, as noted above, and therefore the failure could not propagate into the vessel pressure boundary. Break sizes this small are bounded by much larger breaks in the plant safety analysis (instantaneous guillotine rupture of; the feedwater line or steam line; for example). This Issue report identifies a condition of indeterminacy regarding full compliance with ASME Code. The available records do not provide the information necessary to determine if a post-surface repair volumetric examination was required on certain small secondary-side RSG piping nozzles. All required examinations and testing of the manufactured nozzles were completed satisfactorily with the potential exception of post-surface repair volumetric examinations. There is no evidence of the existence of any actual flaw in any of the affected nozzles. There is no evidence of any degradation in any of the affected nozzles. There has been no evidence of any pressure boundary leakage at these nozzles since the RSGs were placed into service. This Issue Report was generated to document notification from the vendor (BWXT) of a potential missed volumetric examination required by ASME Section III NB-4453.4. Exelon will initiate the appropriate actions to address a potential ASME Code nonconformance per CC-AA-11 and other applicable procedures. Exelon concurs this issue does not create a substantial safety hazard based on the evaluation provided by BWXT (reference BWXT letter Rev. 1, dated August 16, 2019).",['50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A)']

"On July 22, 2020, Operations discovered an issue with the Unit 2 OPRM setpoints (see IR 4358276). A reportability review was undertaken by RA, Ops, nuclear fuels, and corporate licensing. One of the potentially applicable reportability criterion that was reviewed was for an event of condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. This criterion was determined to not be reportable based on the fact that the OPRM instrumentation is not a safety-related SSC required to mitigate the consequences of an accident as discussed in Chapters 6 and 15 of the UFSAR. It was concluded that UFSAR Section 15.4.11 evaluated use of OPRM for mitigation of an anticipated operational occurrence (AOO) and not an accident and was therefore out of the scope of the safety function reportability criterion. The NRC Senior Resident inspector pointed out to site RA that NUREG 1022, Rev 3, ""Event Report Guidelines,"" also states that events of moderate frequency as discussed in Reg Guide 1.70 are to be considered as reportable. Reg Guide 1.70, ""Standard Format and Content of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants,"" requires that accidents of moderate frequency be discussed in the station's UFSAR.

On August 4, 2019, securing high pressure core spray injection was added. On August 6, 2019, an unanalyzed condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the primary containment function due to being outside the initial conditions to ensure that drywell and containment pressures remain within design values during a loss of coolant accident. The latter two notifications were late. Screening: The inspectors determined the performance deficiency was minor. The inspectors determined the initial, on time notification triggered the appropriate Agency event response. Additionally, all necessary notifications were eventually made with those on August 4, 2019, and August 6, 2019, beyond the time requirements of NRC regulations. Enforcement: This failure to comply constitutes a minor violation that is not subject to enforcement action in accordance with the NRC's Enforcement Policy.","['50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B)', '50.72(b)(3)(v)(C)', '50.72(b)(3)(v)(D)']"

"This issue report is a follow-up to IR 4442083, ""Correction Required for Byron 2021 NRC Exercise Report"": ""While reviewing EP tasks remaining for the year and referencing EP-AA-120-F-03 it was identified that the currently submitted drill report for Byron Station's NRC Graded Exercise does not take credit for completing a Core Damage Assessment Drill.

Consequently, I was assigned the task to ""draft and submit corrected drill report for Byron Station 2021 NRC Exercise noting that Core Damage Assessment is an additional drill credited to the exercise"" (4442083-02). In support of this assignment, site EP emailed the following: ""I spoke to Ýcorporate EP manager¨ last week and per his direction I have created IR 04442083 to have the Byron Station NRC Graded Exercise Drill Report corrected. We did not take credit for the Core Damage Assessment annual drill requirement and we should have. We graded objective I.2 and it was satisfactory which is the minimum requirement to take credit for the CDAM drill. I also reviewed all of the demonstration criteria and they were satisfactory as well. I have attached a pdf that includes the checklists for the Core Thermal Engineer, Tech Manager, and CDAM reports as well for supporting documentation."" ""Under ERO Performance Objective Summary add ""Core Damage Assessment"" under the item ""Additional drills credited to this Exercise"""" ""Once corrected please resubmit for review and approval. Once approved I will forward to records management."" The pdf attached to this email is titled ""CDAM Info."" As stated, it includes the exercise participants CDAM reports, which are date and time stamped as follows: 08:32 03/23/2021: No Core Damage 09:57 03/23/2021: Cladding Failure <1% based on CETs (<1% = No Core Damage) 10:42 03/23/2021: 2% Cladding Failure based on Containment Radiation 10:58 03/23/2021: 46% Cladding Failure based on CETs 11:09 03/23/2021: 83% Cladding Failure based on CETs Base on this CDAM Info, I do not believe Objective I.2 was satisfied. For comparison, this exercise scenario was developed with a core damage estimate of 4% clad failure based on the peak containment radiation (2456 R/hr) at 1151. This exercise scenario was developed with a core damage estimate of 4% clad failure, whereas the exercise participants estimated 83% clad failure. This is an exceptionally large disparity that was not justified or documented in the original report according to EP-AA-122-300-F-04 Drill & Exercise Post-Event Critique & Report Development Guidance. The 'CDAM Info' was not provided by site EP or reported by the TSC Lead Evaluator during the formal report writing meeting on August 24. Contrary to one claim, it was not discussed during the formal report writing meeting. Apparently, it was never discussed with the TSC Lead Evaluator. It was not included in her emailed lists of ""DCs UNSAT and SAT w/ comments"" or ""Additional Comments for the TSC from Byron Critique. In retrospect, the 'CDAM Info' was conspicuously missing during the formal evaluation and report development of this regulated and NRC graded exercise -- information which indicates Objective I.2 should have been failed. Relevant Scenario and CDAM Timeline: 0832 Core Damage Assessment: No Core Damage 0945: Large break LOCA into Containment and a Potential Loss of the Containment (SAE T=0) 0957 Core Damage Assessment: Cladding Failure <1% based on CETs 0958: SAE declaration 1040: Containment high range rad monitors increased > 1.05 E+03 R/hr with a radiological release in progress (GE T=0) 1042: Core Damage Assessment: 2% Cladding Failure based on Containment Radiation 1043: GE declaration was made based on containment radiation (> 1.05 E+03 R/hr) 1057 (approximately): CETs indicated > 1200 *F for 5 minutes 1058: Core Damage Assessment: 46% Cladding Failure based on CETs 1109: Core Damage Assessment: 83% Cladding Failure based on CETs 1151: Containment radiation peaks at 2456 R/hr 1210: Exercise termination - Radiological release rate increased until exercise termination. Based on the CDAM Info provided by site EP, the exercise participants did not perform any core damage assessments between 1109 and 1210 (exercise termination). Because containment radiation levels (and radiological release rates) continued to increase well after 1109, additional core damage assessment were required by EP-AA-112-200-F-11, CORE / THERMAL HYDRAULIC ENGINEER CHECKLIST, to satisfy Objective I.2. Based on the CDAM Info, the participants stopped assessing core damage at 1109 even though there were clear indications degrading core conditions at 1151. Given this information, it seems Objective I.2 should have been failed. The following questions remain unanswered by site and corporate EP: Why did the participants stop assessing core damage after 1109? Are there core damage assessments missing from the ""CDAM Info"" provided by site EP? If the participants performed core damage assessments after 1109, did they believe reestablishing core cooling repaired 79% clad failure? The exercise scenario was developed using the Containment Radiation method to assess core damage because it is ""optimized for large break LOCA conditions"" which existed in this exercise scenario. Given this, why didn't the participants use the Containment Radiation method to assess core damage after 1109? The participants used the wrong method to assess core damage. They used the CET Temperature method to perform the 1058 (46% clad failure) and 1109 (83% clad failure) core damage assessments. After 1109, the CET temperatures were less than 1200*F because core cooling had been reestablished; therefore, if any later core damage assessments were performed using the CET method, they would have indicated less than 1% clad damage (no core damage). Because reestablishing core cooling cannot repair or reduce the level of clad damage, the CET method was obviously inaccurate and should not have been used. The participants used the Containment Radiation method at 1042 (2%) and, the General Emergency was declared at 1043 based on containment radiation. Why did they not use the Containment Radiation method after 1109? If the participants had used the Containment Radiation method after 1109, it would have indicated approximate 4% as the scenario was developed (2456 R/hr at 1151). Nevertheless, they would have failed Objective I.2 because their prior core damage assessments (46% and 83%) were grossly inaccurate. Notably, reestablishing core cooling will not repair clad damage. This information was discussed and emailed to site and corporate EP. Despite my questions and concerns, site and corporate EP still contend that Objective I.2 was satisfied without answering direct questions or providing formal justification for inclusion in the revised report. Several times, I stated that without justification documented in the report, I did not feel comfortable revising the report to include credit for successfully satisfying the I.2 Objective or signing it. Because I was assigned to revised and sign the report, I also stated, I believe I have a legitimate need - if not the right - for the information I have requested. In response, I received the follow replies from site EP: -""A report would not be required Ýafter 1109¨ unless there was an increase in potential core damage."" -""The Ý1109 core damage assessment¨ report included in the email I sent was the highest predicted over the course of the exercise and an additional report would not have been generated until a more accurate assessment would have been generated utilizing chemistry sample results which wouldn't have been available until after the exercise had already been terminated."" -""As stated during the teams meeting last week and demonstration provided in the two CDAM assessments above the Ýparticipants 1109¨ core damage assessment was accurate for the data provided."" -""The demonstration criteria was considered sat ÝSatisfied¨ and therefore would not have additional information provided."" -""You are signing as the preparer of the report based off of the information and grading provided to you by the lead evaluator in the Emergency Response Facility and the EP staff at the station."" Under these circumstances, I find it problematic to revise the Byron NRC Graded Exercise Report and sign-off that Objective I.2 was satisfied, particularly in a regulated exercise such as this. Accordingly, I respectfully request that my concerns and questions be evaluated in Byron's Corrective Action Program.",['50.72(b)(3)(xiii)']

"There are no safety or operability impacts from this notification, and all MAPLHGRs remain valid as related to this IR. The Nine Mile Point Unit 1 (NMP1) TRACG-LOCA analysis basedeck utilized a generic scram control rod drive (CRD) position curve with no delay consistent with NEDE-33005P-A (TRACG Application for Emergency Core Cooling Systems / Loss-of-Coolant-Accident Analyses for BWR/2-6"", Revision 2, May 2018); however, NEDE-33005P-A further stipulates that the plant technical specification scram curve should be utilized. The NMP1 basedeck is updated with the inputs corresponding to the NMP1 scram curve and a conservative delay between LOCA signal and CRD motion, which results in the core power level being slightly elevated for a short period of time. The current analysis of record peak clad temperature is 2105 deg F with a limit of 2200 deg F. Previous assessments include an 8 deg F improvement for a net PCT of 2097 deg F as reported in NMP1L3444 dated January 27, 2022. The Nine Mile Point Unit 1 TRACG-LOCA basedeck is updated with the correct scram reactivity curve and conservative delay. The estimated PCT impact is 0 deg F. The estimated maximum local oxidation impact is < 0.2%. There is no impact on the Core-Wide Metal-Water reaction. The notification is applicable to NMP Unit 1 only.

"This report is a follow-up to IR 4368043, 'MSIVs are NOT PCIVs,' and IR 4300127, which provide sufficient evidence to conclude that MSIV leakage rate Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement (TSSR) 3.6.1.3.10 is potentially inadequate. IR 4300127 explains: ""As described In SAND2008-6601, the MSIV leakage misconception becomes embarrassingly obvious. It is both a regulatory and a design basis misconception. The MSIVs are considered primary CONTAINMENT isolation valves in current plant UFSAR/technical specifications and not REACTOR isolation valves. Their design basis/TS allowable leakage rates are based on PRIMARY CONTAINMENT pressure Ý~50 psig¨ when their actual leakage rates are a function of REACTOR pressure Ý~1000 psig¨."" Note: SAND2008-6601, ""Analysis of Main Steam Isolation Valve Leakage in Design Basis Accidents ... ""is the Sandia National Laboratories study that discredited NRC Regulatory Guide 1.183. IR 4368043 states: ""flow rates are directly proportional to pressure,"" which is consistent with Bernoulli's Law. Flow (MSIV leakage rate) is proportional to the square root of differential pressure; therefore, TSSR 3.6.1.3.10 is also non-conservative. IR 4368043 exposed the systematic removal of 'Reactor Coolant Isolation Valve' and similar descriptions of MSIVs from plant TS and UFSAR. NRC Generic Letter 91-08, ""Removal of Component Lists From Technical Specifications,"" prompted the effort by eliminating lists that identified MSIVs as ""Reactor Coolant Isolation Valves."" Aided by GL 91-08, NUREG-1433/1434 effectively blurred the regulatory distinctions between MSIVs (GDC-55) and PCIVs (GDC-56). Notably, the one Constellation BWR plant that did NOT adopt ""Standard Technical Specifications"" (equivalent to NUREG-1433), currently identifies MSIVs as ""Reactor Coolant System Isolation Valves"" in TS 3.2.7/4.2.7 and lists MSIVs in UFSAR Table Vl-3a, titled ""Reactor Coolant System Isolation Valves."" Nine Mile Point Unit 1, UFSAR Section VI (Rev. 26, October 2019) includes the following definitions: -""Containment isolation valves (also called isolation valves) are defined as any valves which are relied upon to perform a containment isolation function on lines penetrating the primary reactor containment and include all reactor coolant isolation valves and all primary containment isolation valves."" -""Primary containment isolation valves are containment isolation valves on lines penetrating the primary reactor containment connecting directly to the free space enclosed by the containment."" -""Reactor coolant isolation valves are containment isolation valves which are on lines penetrating the primary reactor containment and are connected to the RCS (or a system containing reactor coolant) and function as reactor coolant pressure boundary (RCPB) components."" The concerns and information identified in IR 4368043 are consistent with the NRC approved, MSIV Technical Specifications at NMP1. By company procedure, IR 4368043 recommended that TSSR 3.6.1.3.10 be evaluated in accordance with NRC Administrative Letter 98-10, ""Dispositioning of Technical Specifications That Are Insufficient to Assure Plant Safety. "" Despite the possibility that TSSR 3.6.1.3.10 might be inadequate, the company failed to comply with AL 98-10, asserting that evaluating the adequacy of the TSSR would ""require that the station violate the current technical specifications and licensing basis documents in favor for other regulatory reports or NRC administrative documents (CAP 4368043-02)."" The company unreasonably claimed that using the guidance provided AL 98-10 (now NRC Regulatory Guide 1.239/NEI 15-03, ""Licensee Actions to Address Nonconservative Technical Specifications) --as the NRC intended-- is somehow illegal, because it would violate the (potentially) inadequate technical specification, or some other unspecified technical specifications or documents. Constellation (formerly Exelon) is the leading member of the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry lobbying organization that developed NEI 15-03. Remarkably, the company defied the industry guidance which they developed and persuaded the NRC to adopt as RG 1.239. In their evaluation of IR 4368043, the company states: ""The station will continue following current station technical specifications and licensing basis documents until told that these documents require revision as directed by a regulatory body."" (4368043-02) Despite the company's indefensible defiance of RG 1.239, the NRC has not required them to disposition the potentially inadequate TSSR 3.6.1.3.10. There have been no regulatory consequences. Conversely, if the company complied with RG 1.239, they would be compelled to perform an Operability Evaluation (OP-AA-108-115, Attachment 1), which could not support MSIVs Operability because TSSR 3.6.1.3.10 does NOT ensure that MSIVs can satisfy their high pressure safety function to isolate the reactor coolant system. In the case of MSIV lnoperability, the company would legally be required to shut down the two Quad Cities reactors. Consequently, the NRC would have little choice but to admit that every BWR that adopted NUREG-1433/1434 has been legally unsafe since NUREG-1433/1434 were published (1995). The company's defiance of RG 1.239, ""Licensee Actions to Address Nonconservative Technical Specifications,"" exposes a broad range of ethical, legal, and regulatory implications. Most important is the Operability of MSIVs (Units 1 and 2) which has yet to be evaluated.",['50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B)']

The fuel defect meets the threshold of Action Level 1 per NF-AA-430 Attachment 2 based on the observed step change in I-131 and Xe-133 activities, as well as the Xe-133/Xe-135 activity ratio exceeding 1.0. The current RCS radionuclide activities do not challenge Technical Specification LCO 3.4.16, RCS Specific Activity Limits for Dose Equivalent Xenon (DEX) or Dose Equivalent Iodine (DEI). The most recent DEX and DEI samples are 1.91 uCi/gm and 1.44 E-3 uCi/gm, respectively, compared to limits of less than 650 uCi/gm for DEX and 1.0 uCi/gm for DEI.",[]
