OA Manifold pressure (1PT-EH037) is reading 1064 psig which is within its required band of &gt;700 psig to &lt;1250 psig. Attempts were made to secure/start an EH pump as well as tripping and relatching the turbine. During the turbine trip, 1PT-EH038 was noted to spike slightly to ~40 psig. This procedure is currently required for entry into Mode 3.

(5/21/24 PG) From the SME: The following actions were taken to clear the apparent obstruction in the EH manifold: 1.The Manifold was taken OOS and the inlet orifice was inspected and cleaned. Nothing abnormal was identified, and this was not successful, as the original improper indications returned when the turbine was relatched the next morning after the system was RTS&apos;d. 2.A trouble shooter was developed to perform steps of MA-BR-772-217 (Solenoid cycling and manifold reset) and BwOP CX-15 (Dummy in EH pressure signal to allow manifold reset) to perform a high pressure flush of the manifold block by cycling one upstream solenoid valve with the remainder of the valves closed. A flowchart showing the desired BwOP CX-15 and MA-BR-772-217 steps for flushing solenoids has been developed and could be compiled into a BwOP procedure format if desired.
