OA Manifold pressure (1PT-EH037) is reading 1064 psig which is within its required band of &gt;700 psig to &lt;1250 psig. Attempts were made to secure/start an EH pump as well as tripping and relatching the turbine. During the turbine trip, 1PT-EH038 was noted to spike slightly to ~40 psig. This procedure is currently required for entry into Mode 3.

(5/21/24 PG) From the SME: The following actions were taken to clear the apparent obstruction in the EH manifold: 1.The Manifold was taken OOS and the inlet orifice was inspected and cleaned. Nothing abnormal was identified, and this was not successful, as the original improper indications returned when the turbine was relatched the next morning after the system was RTS&apos;d. 2.A trouble shooter was developed to perform steps of MA-BR-772-217 (Solenoid cycling and manifold reset) and BwOP CX-15 (Dummy in EH pressure signal to allow manifold reset) to perform a high pressure flush of the manifold block by cycling one upstream solenoid valve with the remainder of the valves closed. A flowchart showing the desired BwOP CX-15 and MA-BR-772-217 steps for flushing solenoids has been developed and could be compiled into a BwOP procedure format if desired.

The 0B Diesel Driven Fire Pump has been out of service since 2022 so there is no new plant deficiency identified with this IR. On 6/11/2024, the new 0B Diesel Driven Fire Pump was ran for site acceptance full flow testing per 0BwOS FP.2.1.E-1B. The new fire pump passed the acceptance criteria for peak load (150% flow) and full capacity (100% flow) but failed the Shuttoff head loading (no flow). The peak load developed head was 108psi with an acceptance criteria of 98-120psi. The full capacity developed head was 158psi with an acceptance criteria of 151-185psi. The Shutoff head was 200psi with an acceptance criteria of 212-259psi. It appears that the acceptance criteria in the surveillance is based on the old pump curve with acceptance being within 10% of the factory pump curve. All measured data with the new motor/pump falls within roughly 7% of the new pumps curve (photo of plot attached). Before submitting the surveillance with failed acceptance criteria, Ops is requesting that engineering review the data and determine if the acceptance criteria should be revised based on the new pump curve.

No Follow Up Reviewed By: JAYME L ROBERTS 06/12/2024 09:21:29 CDT Follow Up Comments: Engineering has reviewed the results of the 0B DDFP testing IAW 0BwOS FP.2.1.E01B. During the full flow testing the 0B DDFP shutoff head was below the minimum acceptance criteria as defined in 0BwOS FP.2.1.E-1B. When the pump was replaced in 2019 under WO # 4843529, full flow capacity testing was performed under WO # 4947232 as a part of the return to service. During the 2019 testing, Peak Load TDH was 110.4 psi, Full Capacity TDH was 160.2 psi, and Shutoff TDH was 213.3 psi. At that time, the acceptance values in the procedure were not updated to reflect the new pump curve from the replacement pump, and instead used the legacy pump curve from the original 0B DDFP included in VTIP L-0958. The capacity testing was performed SAT in 2019 and no challenges were noted despite the use of the historic curve. 2024 testing performed in support of the 0B DDFP return to service resulted in Peak Load TDH of 108 psi, Full Capacity TDH of 158 psi, and a Shutoff Head of 200 psi. A review of the test data against the updated 2019 pump curve shows that all associated fall within 10% of the rated pump curve and that the 0B DDFP can provide rated capacity at each load condition. Based on the above information, 0BwOS FP.2.1.E-1B should be updated to reflect the replacement pump and ensure testing going forward utilizes the appropriate pump curve for the installed equipment. Operable Basis: Reportable Basis: No thresholds of the Constellation Reportability Reference Manual are exceeded. Functional Basis: 0B FP pump is not consider functional and GOCAR 1A2 remains in effect. 0B FP Pump is available and post maintenance testing is still in-progress to prove functionality.

04788565,20240801,PCRA,4   ,"Originator: GARRETT G GUSLOFF Supv Contacted: M. Tubergan Condition Description: Whilst performing 0BwOS FP.2.2.M-2 step F.13, it was identified that the strainer flush cannot be performed as directed. F.13 calls for you to install a hose fitting and Tygon before flushing the strainer for 0FP5098. This process would require you to remove the plug in the strainer. The problem is, there is a grounding strap attached to that drain plug. This grounding strap should be moved to a more permanent location before trying to remove this plug and flushing the strainer. The second problem is the procedure never directs any closure of the isolation valve 0FP5219. This is the normal water strainer isolation valve. If this valve was left open and the strainer cap was removed (as the procedure is currently written) water would uncontrollably spew from the strainer with not procedural way to stop it. The way the procedure should be written is, bypass the normal cooling flow by opening the cooling flow bypass line, isolate the normal cooling flow, flush the normal cooling flow strainer, restore normal cooling flow configuration, flush the bypass cooling flow strainer, and finally restore the bypass cooling line configuration. Which brings me to problem three. The bypass cooling flow strainer drain is pointed directly at 0PT-FP019 &apos;post-strainer pressure transmitter.&apos; Not only does the strainer plug not have enough room to physically be removed with the transmitter in the way, it is not advisable to flush cooling flow directly at a flow transmitter. The strainer will need to be rotated such that it can point away from the transmitter and flushed properly. Another solution to these problems would be if a garden hose attachment was installed on the strainers similar to the old fire pump. This would include a threaded connection we could attach a garden hose to that would be routed to the drain as well as a no EPN isolation valve to be used to control flushing flow.

This alarm is located on the Indikon Power Module Type PM-606. A review of Unit One turbine bearing vibration computer points as well as parameters on DEH OWS graphic 5508 revealed nothing abnormal. No procedural guidance could be found for operation of the instrument. Assignment Report (AR) #4134194 addressed a similar issue wherein it was identified #2 and #3 bearing vibration sensors showed probe gap readings of 2.0 and 1.5 respectively. It continued by stating any reading below 3 would bring in the sensor alarm. IMD was subsequently engaged to raise the two vibration sensors to obtain the correct gap readings. Immediate actions taken: Informed the Unit One Unit Supervisor (US).

My recollection was that the first time we got the alarm the U1 RMS computer power flickered but nothing further. The second time, in December, we lost power to the U1 RMS computer for an appreciable amount of time, but nothing further. The most recent time we then proceeded to lose the whole PPC and several monitors. The older IRs were just a loss to the RMS computer and a degraded power plug was replaced to resolve. It does seem interesting that this time 1-4-C6 was back operable within 18 seconds, while the PPC remained down.

From OTS: The power fault came from the 1CX08J invertor. The power was lost to the entire room for anything fed by the 1CX08J invertor and operations told OTS that nothing was done to resolve it, it resolved itself relatively quickly, however, the entirety of the system doesn&apos;t fully restart on its own from a power loss. OTS followed their guidance they have to restart the system after the power failure and PPC returned. Over last 2-3 years, these PPC inverters (on both units) have been causing issues on substantially higher frequency that they have in the preceding 15 years or so. Dropping the power to the entire PPC room and its equipment can have detrimental effects to the equipment. There has been lost equipment in the past from these events, it can lead to data corruption as well since many systems contain hard drives. This event did not cause any equipment from being able to be returned to service.

04829226,20250123,PCRA,4   ,"Originator: KEVIN M MORES Supv Contacted: Conquest Condition Description: Performed a commonality review of surveillances for Byron/Braidwood. A difference was noted between the Essential Service Water ASME surveillances between the stations, specifically, Braidwood surveillances 1/2BwOSR 5.5.8.SX-3A/B and 1/2BwOSR 5.5.8.SX-6A/B and Byron Surveillances 1/2BOSR 5.5.8.SX.5-1c/2c. Braidwood&apos;s surveillance tests the pump specific discharge check valve whereas Byron&apos;s ASME surveillance tests the opposite train&apos;s check valve. This leads to every ASME performed at Braidwood requiring a pump swap at some point compared to Byron which can perform ASMEs on the running SX pump and limit swaps. A review of the Braidwood/Byron Logs from 1/1/2022 through present shows that Braidwood swaps SX pumps more frequently than Byron. At Braidwood, each SX pump averages ~19 pump starts per year compared to Byron which average ~9 pump starts per year per pump. The major contributors to the number of pump swaps at Braidwood are ASME surveillances, CC Heat Exchanger Flushes, valve strokes, outage lineups, and plant lineups for maintenance. To a lesser extent Chem Feed Lineup support and Forebay Outage windows also require SX pump swaps. At Byron, pumps are swapped to support ASME surveillance lineups, outage lineups, and plant lineups for maintenance. Of note, the Braidwood surveillances also cycle the lube oil inlet and returns 1/2SX2179A/B and 1/2SX2180A/B, which is not performed at Byron. These manipulations required the pump to be secured and LCO entry for the applicable pump. An ATI will be created for Ops services to separate L.O. cooler valve cycles from the ASME PM and align LCO entries in the appropriate weeks. Immediate actions taken: Discussed with IST, Engineering, Ops Services. Initiated IR for review of SX ASME Surveillances to align with Byron and limit pump swaps. Recommended Actions: IST to evaluate Braidwood surveillances 1/2BwOSR 5.5.8.SX-3A/B and 1/2BwOSR 5.5.8.SX-6A/B to check opposite train discharge check valve vice train specific to limit SX pump swap during each ASME. Include evaluation of lube oil cooler cycling in the review and work with Ops services for best scheduling practice. ATI for services to submit PMMR to separate L.O. cooler valve cycles from the ASME PM and align LCO entries in the appropriate weeks. PCRA to Ops Support to update Braidwood surveillances 1/2BwOSR 5.5.8.SX-3A/B and 1/2BwOSR 5.5.8.SX-6A/B based on IST Recommendations and Byron procedure.

04831485,20250128,PCRA,4   ,"Originator: JOSEPH M GHORMLEY Supv Contacted: Azeam Anjum Condition Description: Whist performing 0BwOS FP 2.2.M-2, the Diesel Driven Fire Pump (0FP03PB) tripped on low ambient temperature. On 0FP04JB there was 2 alarms in Pump Room Trouble and the other was Low Ambient Temperature. The Fire pump did enter its cooldown cycle. The room temperature indicated on 0FP04JB was 37F. At the start of the run room temp was 44F on the screen and was checked with a thermometer. When the pump entered its cooldown cycle temp was checked with a thermometer by the pump and was found to be 49F but was significantly lower at the louver. The louvers were open and the 0FP04JB is close to the louver. Per BwOP FP-8 E.7 0FP03PB is declared inoperable if room temp is &lt; 40F and if Cooling water is &lt; 120F. Cooling water is currently 142F. So the pump is still operable. Per 0BwOS FP 2.2.M-2 the louvers open whenever the diesel fire pump is in start. So the louvers were operating as intended. We had already taken all our data for the run and were about to shut the pump off per BwOP FP-8.

NWSC review complete Follow Up Reviewed By: JAYME L ROBERTS 01/23/2025 12:46:15 CST Follow Up Comments: Strategic engineering has reviewed the starting sequence outlined in BwOP FP-8 and the event logs obtained from the diesel driven fire pump runs that were performed on 1/21/2025 and 12/16/2024. During the most recent event, it was identified that a controlled, automatic shutdown of the engine occurred after 33 minutes. The same controller sequence was observed during the 12/16 test as well. A review of the associated Firetrol Controller manual and a discussion with the vendor determined that when the controller is run in TEST mode using the test button as outlined in BwOP FP-8, there is a built in 30-minute TEST logic configured to the controller that will automatically end the test run at 30 minutes. Additionally, based on a review of the Cummins Engine vendor manual it was confirmed that there is a built-in cooldown window as the engine shuts down. As a result, using the TEST function of the controller will result in an engine runtime of 30 minutes with an approximate 3-minute cooldown period before the engine shuts off. This information should be clarified within BwOP FP-8. It was also noted that the battery display for the control panel is currently indicating at no charge. The discussion with the vendor was that this battery is responsible for volatile settings such as date/time, but it should not have been indicating as no charge if the controller battery was properly installed. Based on the above information, the following actions are recommended: A PCRA to the operations procedure group to include lessons learned regarding auto-start functionality and the expected conditions. A WR to be scheduled the next time the engine is OOS to investigate the controller panel (0FP03JB) and determine if the associated battery is installed correctly. A contingency task is required to replace the battery.

04835805,20250218,MREQ,4   ,"Originator: MATTHEW F TAMMEN Supv Contacted: Anjum Condition Description: While reviewing BwOP CO-5T2 for manual actuation of CO2 to the UCSR it was found that Pushbutton #2 for Zone 2EE3 (2S-50) has its location as being given: &quot;2HS-CO072 AUX BLDG 463&apos; P-20 FROM TURB BLDG&quot; While the location 463&apos; P-20 matches Asset Suite&apos;s given location, the description &quot;FROM TURB BLDG&quot; is potentially dangerous in this context. The location of this actuator is shown on Pre-Fire Plan #34 and #36 in Zone 2EE4 next to the door to zone 2EE3. This is on the &quot;Clean&quot; Side of the UCSR, as opposed to the other actuators which are on the RCA side of the rope. The intent of this description was probably to delineate this difference, but it makes no sense in the context of this procedure. The reason you would be manually actuating CO2 to zone 2EE3 is because 2EE3 is on fire and Halon failed to actuate automatically (but potentially could actuate at any time). Manual CO2 pushbutton 1 is in a better location for actuation but could also have failed. If you wanted to use Station 2 to blanket the zone it would only make sense to access this pushbutton from the Aux Building Side, cross the Rad Rope (which due to the fire, radiological issues are secondary concerns), and actuate the station from there. To access the pushbutton &quot;FROM TURB BLDG&quot; would require an EO to pass through 2EE3 (which is the zone presumably on fire). Following the Fire Response, RP can be notified to adjust the Rad Boundary to all of 2EE4 and follow up with surveys. It is also worth mentioning that procedures for Manual Actuation of CO2 (BwOP CO-5 series) have been put into &quot;Dynamic Procedure&quot; format. This is completely inappropriate. Imagine, the UCSR is on fire, a location immediately above the Main Control Room (probably with many spurious system actuations occurring due to electrical shorts): is it desired for Operations to stop to get an iPad and assign manual actuation of CO2 to someone, then bring the iPad with them hoping to not have technical issues (i.e. mandatory updates, pages loading mid procedure, stylus issues, etc.)? Can a situation be described where utilizing this procedure for its intended purpose during a fire would be appropriate in this format? This procedure should only be in paper format and staged for use as it always has been in binders in the plant. It seems like a gross oversight of the organization to allow this to have happened. Peoples&apos; lives could be at stake during a fire response. If this is simple blind adherence to transitioning all procedures to Dynamic format regardless of who may be harmed in the process, then we should be ashamed as an organization. Personnel Safety should be the station&apos;s priority. Immediate actions taken: Notified Supervisor, Generated IR Recommended Actions: Revise location description of Pushbutton 2 in BwOP CO-5T2.
