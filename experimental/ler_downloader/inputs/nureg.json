The initiation of any nuclear plant shutdown required by the plant's Technical Specifications (TS) should be apparent at the time of occurrence. Therefore, if all events are reported properly, it is expected that all reports under 10 CFR 50.72 are as a result of an on-going condition. If the shutdown is completed, an LER is required.",
        "Discussion": "The 10 CFR 50.72 reporting requirement is intended to capture those events for which TS require the initiation of reactor shutdown to provide the NRC with early warning of safety-significant conditions serious enough to warrant that the plant be shut down. For 10 CFR 50.72 reporting purposes, the phrase \"initiation of any nuclear plant shutdown\" includes action to start reducing reactor power; i.e., adding negative reactivity to achieve a nuclear plant shutdown required by TS. This includes initiation of any shutdown due to expected inability to restore equipment prior to exceeding the LCO action time. As a practical matter, in order to meet the time limits for reporting under 10 CFR 50.72, the reporting decision should sometimes be based on such expectations. (See Example 4.) The \"initiation of any nuclear plant shutdown\" does not include mode changes required by TS if they are initiated after the plant is already in a shutdown condition. A reduction in power for some other purpose, not constituting initiation of a shutdown required by TS, is not reportable under this criterion. For 10 CFR 50.73 reporting purposes, the phrase \"completion of any nuclear plant shutdown\" is defined as the point in time during a TS-required shutdown when the plant enters the first shutdown condition required by an LCO (e.g., hot standby (Mode 3) for PWRs with the Standard Technical Specifications (STS)). For example, if at 0200 hours a plant enters an LCO action statement that states, \"restore the inoperable channel to operable status within 12 hours or be in at least Hot Standby within the next 6 hours,\" the plant must be shut down (i.e., at least in hot standby) by 2000 hours. An LER is required if the inoperable channel is not returned to operable status by 2000 hours and the plant enters hot standby. An LER is not required if a failure was or could have been corrected before a plant has completed shutdown (as discussed above) and no other criteria in 10 CFR 50.73 apply.",

With less than four reactor coolant pumps operating, the plant entered a\n1-hour LCO to be in hot standby. Control rods were manually inserted to place the plant\nin a shutdown condition.\n\nThe licensee made an ENS notification because of the initiation of a TS-required plant\nshutdown. An LER was required because of the completion of the TS-required plant\nshutdown.\n\n(3)\nFailure that Was or Could Have Been Corrected Before Shutdown Was Required\n\n· Question: What about the situation where you have 7 days to fix a component or\nbe shut down, but the plant must be shut down to fix the component? Assume\nthe plant shuts down, the component is fixed, and the plant returns to power\nbefore the end of the 7-day period. Is that situation reportable?\n\nAnswer: No. If the shutdown was not required by the TS, it need not be\nreported. However, other criteria in 50.73 may apply and may require that the\nevent be reported.\n\n· Question: Suppose that there are 7 days to fix a problem, and it is likely that the\nproblem can be fixed during this time period. However, the plant management\nelects to shut down and fix this problem and other problems. Is an LER\nrequired?\n\nAnswer: No. Some judgment is required. The shutdown is reportable, however,\nif the situation could not have been corrected before the plant was required to be\nshut down.\n\n(4)\nInitiation of Plant Shutdown in Anticipation of an LCO-Required Shutdown\n\nThe plant lost one of two sources of offsite power due to overheating in the main\ntransformer. The TS allow 72 hours to restore the source or initiate a shutdown and be\nin hot standby within the next 6 hours and cold shutdown within the following 30 hours.\nThe licensee estimated that the transformer problem could not be corrected within the\nLCO action time. Therefore, the decision was made to start a shutdown soon after the\ntransformer problem was discovered.\n\nThe shutdown was uneventful and was completed, with the plant in hot standby, before\nthe expiration of the LCO action time. After the plant reached hot standby, further\nevaluation indicated that the transformer problem could not be corrected before the\nrequirement to place the plant in cold shutdown. Based on this time estimate, it was\ndecided to place the unit in cold shutdown.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"17\" -->\n\n ----- page_no: 30\n\nThe event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(i) as the initiation of a plant shutdown\nrequired by TS because, at the time the shutdown was initiated and the time the report\nwas due, it was not expected that the equipment would be restored to operable status\nwithin the required time. This is based on the fact that the reporting requirement is\nintended to capture those events for which TS require the initiation of a reactor\nshutdown.\n\nThe event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(A) because the plant shutdown was\ncompleted when the plant reached hot standby (Mode 3).

        "Discussion": "Safety Limits and Limiting Safety System Settings The regulation in 10 CFR 50.36(c)(1) outlines the reporting requirements in TS for events in which safety limits or limiting safety system settings are exceeded. It indicates that such reports are to be made as required by 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73. There would not be a 3-year limitation in this case because, in addition to the requirements of 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73, specific reporting requirements are stated in 10 CFR 50.36(c)(1), and perhaps in the plant's TS. 3 This criterion does not address violations of license conditions that are contained in documents other than the TS. Such violations are reportable as specified in the plant's license or other applicable documents. ----- page_no: 31 #### Limiting Conditions for Operation The regulation in 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) outlines LCOs in TS. Certain TS contain LCO statements that include action statements (required actions and their associated completion time in the STS) to provide constraints on the length of time components or systems may remain inoperable or out of service before the plant must shut down or other compensatory measures must be taken. Such time constraints are based on the safety significance of the component or system being removed from service. An LER is required if a condition existed for a time longer than permitted by the TS (i.e., greater than the total allowed restoration and shutdown outage time (or completion time in the STS)), even if the condition was not discovered until after the allowable time had elapsed and the condition was rectified immediately upon discovery. This guidance is consistent with that previously given. (For the purpose of this discussion, it is assumed that there was firm evidence that a condition prohibited by TS existed before discovery, for a time longer than permitted by TS.) #### Technical Specification Surveillance Testing The regulation in 10 CFR 50.36(c)(3) outlines surveillance requirements in TS that assure (1) the necessary quality of systems and components, (2) operation within safety limits, and (3) meeting the LCOs. Generally, an operation or condition prohibited by the TS existed and is reportable if surveillance testing indicates that equipment (e.g., one train of a multiple-train system) was not capable of performing its specified safety functions (and thus was inoperable) for a period of time longer than allowed by TS (i.e., the LCO-allowed outage time, or the completion time for restoration of equipment in the STS). Reporting is not required if an event consists solely of a case of a late surveillance test in which the oversight is corrected, the test is performed, and the equipment is found to be capable of performing its specified safety functions. For the purpose of evaluating the reportability of a discrepancy found during surveillance testing that is required by the TS, licensees should do the following: (1) For testing that is conducted within the required time (i.e., the surveillance interval plus any extension allowed by STS Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.0.2 or its equivalent), it should be assumed that the discrepancy occurred at the time of its discovery unless there is firm evidence, based on a review of relevant information such as the equipment history and the cause of failure, to indicate that the discrepancy existed previously. (2) For testing that is conducted later than the required time, it should be assumed that the discrepancy occurred at the time the testing was required unless there is firm evidence to indicate that it occurred at a different time. The purpose of this approach is twofold. First, it rules out reporting of routine occurrences (i.e., occurrences for which a timely surveillance test is performed, the results fall outside of acceptable limits, and the condition is corrected) unless there is firm evidence that equipment was incapable of performing its specified safety function longer than allowed. On the other hand, if the surveillance test is performed substantially late, and the equipment is not capable of performing its specified safety function, the occurrence is not routine. In this case, the event is ----- page_no: 32 reportable unless there is firm evidence that the duration of the discrepancy was within allowed limits. For cases in which it is discovered that a surveillance test was not performed within its specified frequency or interval, some plants have TS that allow a delay in declaring an LCO or that TS requirements were not met (i.e., STS SR 3.0.3 or its equivalent). This allows time to perform the test before making such a declaration and taking other required actions. However, an LER would still be required if the test indicates that equipment (e.g., one train of a multiple-train system) was not capable of performing its specified safety functions (and thus was inoperable) for a period of time longer than allowed by TS. The allowed delay in declaring the LCO not met does not change the fact that the condition existed longer than allowed by TS. Tests Required by Section XI of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Code In 10 CFR 50.55a(g) and 50.55a(f), the NRC requires the implementation of inservice inspection and inservice testing programs in accordance with the applicable edition of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code for those pumps and valves whose function is required for safety. The STS contain these testing requirements. As with surveillance testing, an operation or condition prohibited by the TS existed and is reportable if the testing indicates that equipment (e.g., one train of a multiple-train system required to be operable by the TS) was not capable of performing its specified safety functions (and thus was inoperable) for a period of time longer than allowed by TS. Accordingly, similar assumptions and standards should be used. For example, if a timely test indicates that equipment is not capable of performing its specified safety function, it should be assumed that the discrepancy occurred at the time of the test unless there is firm evidence to indicate that it existed previously. #### Design and Analysis Defects and Deviations A design or analysis defect or deviation is reportable under this criterion if, as a result, equipment (e.g., one train of a multiple-train system) was not capable of performing its specified safety functions (and thus was inoperable) for a period of time longer than allowed by TS. Because design and analysis conditions are long lasting, the essential question in this case is whether the equipment was capable of performing its specified safety functions. #### Administrative Requirements Section 5 of the STS, or its equivalent, has a number of administrative requirements, such as organizational structure, the required number of personnel on shift, the maximum hours of work permitted during a specific interval of time, and the requirement to have, maintain, and implement certain specified procedures. Violation of a TS that is administrative in nature is not reportable. For example, a change in the plant's organizational structure that has not yet been approved as a TS change would not be reportable. An administrative procedure violation, or failure to implement a procedure, such as failure to lock a high-radiation-area door, is generally not reportable under this criterion. Radiological conditions and events that are reportable are defined in 10 CFR 20.2202, \"Notification of Incidents,\" and 10 CFR 20.2203, \"Reports of Exposures, Radiation Levels, and Concentrations of Radioactive Material Exceeding the Constraints or Limits.\" Redundant reporting is not required. ----- page_no: 33 ##### Entry into STS 3.0.3 STS LCO 3.0.3, or its equivalent, establishes requirements for actions when (1) an LCO is not met and the associated actions are not met, (2) an associated action is not provided, or (3) as directed by the associated actions themselves. Entry into LCO 3.0.3 or its equivalent is not necessarily reportable under this criterion. However, it should be considered reportable under this criterion if any of the shutdown times listed in LCO 3.0.3 (e.g., Modes 3, 4, or 5 for the Westinghouse STS) were exceeded, even if the condition was not discovered until after the allowable time had elapsed and the condition was rectified immediately upon discovery. For a given LCO condition, if shutdown required actions and completion times are listed (e.g., be in hot shutdown in X hours and cold shutdown in Y hours), shutdown times associated with LCO 3.0.3 should not be considered (i.e., only consider LCO action table shutdown completion time added to restorative completion time when determining if \"Operations or Conditions Prohibited by Technical Specifications\" existed). If entry into LCO 3.0.3 is explicitly listed as a required action for a given condition, or for cases in which the condition is not listed in the action table, shutdown times associated with LCO 3.0.3 may be added to any associated restorative completion times found in the action table when determining if \"Operations or Conditions Prohibited by Technical Specifications\" existed. The discussion contained in this section only pertains to \"Operations or Conditions Prohibited by Technical Specifications.\" Entry into LCO 3.0.3 may still result in other reportable conditions under 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73. #### Revised Technical Specifications An LER is not required for discovery of an operation or condition that occurred in the past and was prohibited at the time it occurred if, before the time of discovery, the TS were revised such that the operation or condition is no longer prohibited. Such an event would have little or no significance because the operation or condition would have been determined to be acceptable and allowed under the current TS.",

Abnormal degradation of a barrier may be indicated by the necessity of taking corrective action to restore the barrier's capability, as is the case in some of the examples discussed below. Abnormal stress upon a barrier may result from an unplanned transient, as is the case in one of the examples discussed below.

(2) Welding or material defects in the primary coolant system that cannot be found acceptable under ASME Section XI, IWB-3600, \"Analytical Evaluation of Flaws,\" or ASME Section XI, Table IWB-3410-1, \"Acceptance Standards.\" (3) Serious steam generator tube degradation. A licensee's plant-specific TS contain performance criteria for steam generator tube integrity, which includes structural integrity, accident induced leakage, and operational leakage. Steam generator tube degradation is considered serious only if either the steam generator structural integrity or accident-induced leakage performance criteria are not met. In addition, one or more steam generator tubes satisfying the tube repair criteria and not plugged or repaired in accordance with the steam generator program is not considered ----- page_no: 38 to be serious steam generator tube degradation and therefore is not reportable as a \"Degraded or Unanalyzed Condition,\" as long as the structural integrity and accident-induced leakage performance criteria are both met. (4) Low temperature over pressure transients in which the pressure-temperature relationship violates pressure-temperature limits derived from Appendix G, \"Fracture Toughness Requirements,\" to 10 CFR Part 50 (e.g., TS pressure-temperature curves). (5) Loss of containment function or integrity, including containment leak rate tests in which the total containment as-found, minimum-pathway leak rate exceeds limits in the facility's TS.4 #### (B) Unanalyzed Condition that Significantly Affects Plant Safety The 1983 Statements of Consideration for 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73 indicated the following with regard to an unanalyzed condition that significantly compromises plant safety: The Commission recognizes that the licensee may use engineering judgment and experience to determine whether an unanalyzed condition existed. It is not intended that this paragraph apply to minor variations in individual parameters, or to problems concerning single pieces of equipment. For example, at any time, one or more safety-related components may be out of service due to testing, maintenance, or a fault that has not yet been repaired. Any trivial single failure or minor error in performing surveillance tests could produce a situation in which two or more often unrelated, safety-grade components are out-of-service. Technically, this is an unanalyzed condition. However, these events should be reported only if they involve functionally related components or if they significantly compromise plant safety.5 When licensees are applying engineering judgment, and there is a doubt regarding whether or not to report, the Commission's policy is that licensees should make the report.6 For example, small voids in systems designed to remove heat from the reactor core that have been previously shown through analysis not to be safety significant need not be reported. However, the accumulation of voids that could inhibit the ability to adequately remove heat from the reactor core, particularly under natural circulation conditions, would constitute an unanalyzed condition and would be reportable.7 4 The LCO typically employs La, which is defined in Appendix J, \"Primary Reactor Containment Leakage Testing for Water-Cooled Power Reactors,\" to 10 CFR Part 50 as the maximum allowable containment leak rate at pressure Pa, the calculated peak containment internal pressure related to the design-basis accident. \"Minimum- pathway leak rate\" means the minimum leak rate that can be attributed to a penetration leakage path; for example, the smaller of either the inboard or outboard valve's individual leak rates. 5 48 FR 39042, August 29, 1983, and 48 FR 33856, July 26, 1983. 6 48 FR 39042, August 29, 1983. 7 48 FR 39042, August 29, 1983, and 48 FR 33856, July 26, 1983. ----- page_no: 39 In addition, voiding in instrument lines that results in an erroneous indication causing the operator to misunderstand the true condition of the plant is also an unanalyzed condition and should be reported.8 The level of significance of these cases generally corresponds to the inability to perform a required safety function. For instance, accumulation of voids that could inhibit the ability to adequately remove heat from the reactor core, particularly under natural circulation conditions, has an effect similar to a condition that could prevent the fulfillment of the safety function of the AFW system. Beyond the examples given in 1983, an example of an event reportable as an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety would be the discovery that a system required to meet the single failure criterion does not do so. In another example, if fire barriers are found to be missing, such that the required degree of separation for redundant safe shutdown trains is lacking, the event would be reportable as an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety. On the other hand, if a fire wrap, to which the licensee has committed, is missing from a safe shutdown train but another safe shutdown train is available in a different fire area, protected such that the required separation for safe shutdown trains is still provided, the event would not be reportable.",

        "Discussion": "This criterion applies only to acts of nature (e.g., tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, lightning, hurricanes, floods) and external hazards (e.g., industrial or transportation accidents). References to acts of sabotage are covered by 10 CFR 73.71, \"Reporting of Safeguards ----- page_no: 41 Events.\" Actual threats or significant hampering from internal hazards are covered by a separate criterion in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ix), as discussed in Section 3.2.10 of this report. The phrase \"actual threat to safety of the nuclear power plant\" is one reporting trigger. This covers those events involving an actual threat to the plant from an external condition or natural phenomenon in which the threat or damage challenges the ability of the plant to continue to operate in a safe manner (including the orderly shutdown and maintenance of shutdown conditions). The licensee should decide if a phenomenon or condition actually threatens the plant. For example, a minor brush fire in a remote area of the site that is quickly controlled by firefighting personnel and, as a result, did not present a threat to the plant should not be reported. However, a major forest fire, large-scale flood, or major earthquake that presents a clear threat to the plant should be reported. As another example, an industrial or transportation accident that occurs near the site, creating a plant safety concern, should be reported. The licensee must use engineering judgment to determine if there was an actual threat. For example, with regard to tornadoes, the decision would be based on such factors as the size of the tornado and its location and path. There are no prescribed limits. In general, situations involving only monitoring by the plant's staff are not reportable, but if preventive actions are taken or if there are serious concerns, then the situation should be carefully reviewed for reportability. Responsive actions, by themselves, do not necessarily indicate actual threats. Those that are purely precautionary, such as placement of sandbags, even though flood levels are not expected to be high enough to require sandbags, do not trigger reporting. Section 3.2.10 of this report discusses the meaning of the phrase \"significantly hampers site personnel in the performance of duties necessary for the safe operation of the plant,\" in the context of internal threats. A natural phenomenon or external condition may also significantly hamper personnel. If so, it is reportable under this criterion. If a snowstorm, hurricane, or similar event significantly hampers personnel in the conduct of activities necessary for the safe operation of the plant, the event is reportable. In the case of snow, the licensee must use judgment based on the amount of snow, the extent to which personnel were hampered, the extent to which additional assistance could have been available in an emergency, the length of time the condition existed, and so forth. For example, if snow prevented shift relief for several hours, the situation would be reportable if the delay were such that site personnel were significantly hampered in the performance of duties necessary for safe operation. For example, shift personnel might exceed normal shift overtime limits, become excessively fatigued, or find it necessary to operate with fewer than the required number of watchstanders in order to allow some to rest.",

        "Discussion": "An event that results or should have resulted in a discharge of the ECCS into the RCS as a result of a valid signal, or an event involving a critical scram, is reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv) (a 4-hour report) unless the actuation resulted from and was part of a preplanned sequence. A valid actuation of any of the systems named in 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(B) is reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) (an 8-hour report) unless the actuation resulted from and was part of a preplanned sequence during testing or reactor operation. A system actuation should be apparent at the time of occurrence. Therefore, if all events are reported properly, it is expected that all reports under 10 CFR 50.72 are as a result of an on- going condition. An actuation of any of the systems named in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B) is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) (a 60-day report) unless the actuation resulted from and was part of a preplanned sequence during testing or reactor operation or the actuation was invalid and occurred while the system was properly removed from service or occurred after the safety function had been already completed. As indicated in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(1), in the case of an invalid actuation reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) other than actuation of the RPS when the reactor is critical, the licensee may, at its option, provide a telephone notification to the NRC Operations Center within 60 days after discovery of the event instead of submitting a written LER. In these cases, the telephone report- (1) Is not considered an LER. (2) Should identify that the report is being made under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). (3) Should provide the following information: (a) the specific train(s) and system(s) that were actuated (b) whether each train actuation was complete or partial (c) whether or not the system started and functioned successfully These paragraphs require events to be reported whenever one of the specified systems actuates either manually or automatically. They are based on the premise that these systems are provided to mitigate the consequences of a significant event and, therefore, (1) they should work properly when called upon, and (2) they should not be challenged frequently or unnecessarily. The Commission is interested in both events in which a system was needed to mitigate the consequences of an event (whether or not the equipment performed properly) and events in which a system actuated unnecessarily. Events involving ECCS discharge to the vessel are generally more serious than actuations without discharge to the vessel. Therefore, this reporting criterion is a 4-hour report. Valid signals that should have resulted in a discharge of the ECCS into the RCS but did not due to some component that had failed or an operator action that was taken are reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv). For example, if a valid ECCS signal was generated by plant conditions and the operator put all ECCS pumps in pull-to-lock position, although no ECCS discharge occurred, the event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv). ----- page_no: 46 Actuations that need not be reported are those initiated for reasons other than to mitigate the consequences of an event (e.g., at the discretion of the licensee as part of a preplanned procedure). The intent is to require reporting of the actuation of systems that mitigate the consequences of significant events. Usually, the staff would not consider this to include single-component actuations because single components of complex systems, by themselves, usually do not mitigate the consequences of significant events. However, in some cases a component would be sufficient to mitigate the event (i.e., perform the safety function) and its actuation would, therefore, be reportable. This position is consistent with the statement that the reporting requirement is based on the premise that these systems are provided to mitigate the consequences of a significant event. Single trains do mitigate the consequences of events, and, thus, train level actuations are reportable. In this regard, the staff considers actuation of an EDG to be actuation of a train-not actuation of a single component-because an EDG mitigates the event (performs the safety function). (See Example 3 below.) The staff also considers intentional manual actions, in which one or more system components are actuated in response to actual plant conditions resulting from equipment failure or human error, to be reportable because such actions would usually mitigate the consequences of a significant event. This position is consistent with the statement that the Commission is interested in events in which a system was needed to mitigate the consequences of the event. For example, starting a safety injection (SI) pump in response to a rapidly decreasing pressurizer level or starting high-pressure coolant injection (HPCI) in response to a loss of feedwater would be reportable. However, shifting alignment of makeup pumps or closing a containment isolation valve for normal operational purposes would not be reportable. Actuation of multichannel actuation systems is defined as actuation of enough channels to complete the minimum actuation logic. Therefore, single-channel actuations, whether caused by failures or otherwise, are not reportable if they do not complete the minimum actuation logic. Note, however, that if only a single logic channel actuates when, in fact, the system should have actuated in response to plant parameters, this would be reportable under these paragraphs as well as under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) (\"event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of .... \"). With regard to preplanned actuations, operation of a system as part of a planned test or operational evolution need not be reported. Preplanned actuations are those that are expected to actually occur due to preplanned activities covered by procedures. Such actuations are those for which a procedural step or other appropriate documentation indicates that the specific actuation is actually expected to occur. Control room personnel are aware of the specific signal generation before its occurrence or indication in the control room. However, if, during the test or evolution, the system actuates in a way that is not part of the planned evolution, that actuation should be reported. For example, if the normal reactor shutdown procedure requires that the control rods be inserted by a manual reactor scram, the reactor scram need not be reported. However, if unanticipated conditions develop during the shutdown that cause an automatic reactor scram, such a reactor scram should be reported. The fact that the safety analysis assumes that a system will actuate automatically during an event does not eliminate the need to report that actuation. Actuations that need not be reported are those initiated for reasons other ----- page_no: 47 than to mitigate the consequences of an event (e.g., at the discretion of the licensee as part of a planned evolution). Note that, if an operator were to manually scram the reactor in anticipation of receiving an automatic reactor scram, this would be reportable just as the automatic scram would be reportable. Valid actuations are those actuations that result from valid signals or from intentional manual initiation, unless it is part of a preplanned test. Valid signals are those signals that are initiated in response to actual plant conditions or parameters satisfying the requirements for initiation of the system. They do not include those that are the result of other signals. Invalid actuations are, by definition, those that do not meet the criteria for being valid. Thus, invalid actuations include actuations that are not the result of valid signals and are not intentional manual actuations. Except for critical scrams, invalid actuations are not reportable by telephone under 10 CFR 50.72. In addition, invalid actuations are not reportable under 10 CFR 50.73 in any of the following circumstances: (1) The invalid actuation occurred when the system was already properly removed from service. This means that all requirements of plant procedures for removing equipment from service have been met. It includes required clearance documentation, equipment and control board tagging, and properly positioned valves and power supply breakers. (2) The invalid actuation occurred after the safety function had already been completed. An example would be RPS actuation after the control rods have already been inserted into the core. If an invalid actuation reveals a defect in the system so that the system failed or would fail to perform its intended function, the event continues to be reportable under other requirements of 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73. When invalid actuations excluded by the conditions described above occur as part of a reportable event, they should be described as part of the reportable event in order to provide a complete, accurate, and thorough description of the event.",

The resultant RCS leak was\nestimated at between 70 and 80 gallons per minute. Charging flow increased due to\nautomatic control system action. The operations staff recognized the symptoms of an\nRCS leak and entered the appropriate off-normal procedure. The procedure directed the\noperations staff to start a second charging pump, and flow was manually increased to\nraise pressurizer level. Based on the response of the pressurizer level, the operations\nstaff determined that a reactor scram and SI were not necessary. Maintenance\npersonnel still at the transmitter closed the instrument block and root valves, terminating\nthe event.\n\nThe staff considers the manual start of the charging pump (which also serves as an\nECCS pump, but with a different valve lineup) in response to dropping pressurizer level\nto be an intentional manual actuation in response to equipment failure or human error\nand reportable because it constitutes deliberate manual actuation of a single component,\nin response to plant conditions, to mitigate the consequences of an event. As discussed\npreviously in this section, actuations that need not be reported are those that are\ninitiated for reasons other than to mitigate the consequences of an event (e.g., at the\ndiscretion of the licensee as part of a planned procedure or evolution)."

        "Discussion": "This criterion is based on the assumption that safety-related SSCs are intended to mitigate the consequences of an accident. SSCs within scope include only safety-related SSCs required by the TS to be operable that are intended to mitigate the consequences of an accident as ----- page_no: 51 discussed in Chapters 6 and 15 of the Final Safety Analysis Report (or equivalent chapters). Accidents are identified as events of moderate frequency, infrequent incidents, or limiting faults as discussed in Regulatory Guide 1.70, \"Standard Format and Content of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants (LWR Edition)\" (or equivalent classifications of the three types of events). The American Nuclear Society (ANS) categorizes these events as Condition II, III, and IV type events. The level of judgment for reporting an event or condition under this criterion is a reasonable expectation of preventing fulfillment of a safety function. In the discussions that follow, many of which are taken from previous NUREG guidance, several different expressions, such as \"would have,\" \"could have,\" \"alone could have,\" and \"reasonable doubt,\" are used to characterize this standard. In the staff's view, all of these should be judged on the basis of a reasonable expectation of preventing fulfillment of the safety function. A SSC that has been declared inoperable is one in which the SSC capability is degraded to a point where it cannot perform with reasonable expectation or reliability. These criteria cover an event or condition in which scoped in SSCs could have failed to perform their intended function because of one or more personnel errors, including procedure violations; equipment failures; inadequate maintenance; or design, analysis, fabrication, equipment qualification, construction, or procedural deficiencies and no redundant equipment in the same system was operable. As a result, for SSCs within the scope of this criterion, a report is required when 1) there is a determination that the SSC is inoperable in a required mode or other specified condition in the TS Applicability, 2) the inoperability is due to one or more personnel errors, including procedure violations; equipment failures; inadequate maintenance; or design, analysis, fabrication, equipment qualification, construction, or procedural deficiencies, and 3) no redundant equipment in the same system was operable. For guidance on determining whether a SSC is operable, see RIS 2005-20, Revision 1. Operable but nonconforming or degraded conditions are not considered reportable under this criterion. As a result, reports are not required when systems are declared inoperable as part of a planned evolution for maintenance or surveillance testing when done in accordance with an approved procedure and the plant's TS (unless a condition is discovered that would have resulted in the system being declared inoperable). In addition, unless a condition is discovered that would have resulted in the system being declared inoperable, reports are not required when systems are declared inoperable solely as a result of Required Actions for which the bases is the assumption of an additional random single failure (i.e. Westinghouse STS, Revision 4, LCO 3.8.1, \"AC Sources - Operating,\" Required Actions A.2, B.2, or C.1 (ADAMS Accession No.ML12100A222)). The event must be reported regardless of whether or not an alternate safety system could have been used to perform the safety function. For example, if the onsite power system was declared inoperable due to equipment failures, the event would be reportable, even if the offsite power system remained operable. For systems that include three or more trains, the inoperability of two or more trains should be reported if, in the judgment of the licensee, the remaining operable trains could not mitigate the consequences of an accident. There are a limited number of single-train systems that perform safety functions (e.g., the HPCI system in BWRs). For such systems, inoperability of the single train is reportable even though the plant TS may allow such a condition to exist for a limited time. ----- page_no: 52 If the retraction or cancellation of a report under this criterion is due to a revised operability determination, the retraction or cancellation should discuss the basis for why the operability determination was revised, and why it is believed that system operability was never lost (i.e., in lieu of the initial determination).",

The oil remaining above the upper pistons after\nshutdown leaked slowly down past the piston rings, into the combustion space, past the\nlower piston rings, through the exhaust ports, and into the exhaust manifolds. The\nexhaust manifolds became pressurized during the subsequent startup, which forced the\noil out through leaks in the exhaust manifold gaskets where it was ignited.

        "Discussion": "This criterion requires those events to be reported in which a single cause or condition caused independent trains or channels to become inoperable. Common causes may include such factors as high ambient temperatures, heatup from energization, inadequate preventive maintenance, oil contamination of air systems, incorrect lubrication, use of nonqualified components, or manufacturing or design flaws. The event is reportable if the independent trains or channels were inoperable at the same time, regardless of whether or not they were discovered at the same time. (Example 2 below illustrates a case in which the second failure was discovered 3 days later than the first.) An event or failure that results in or involves the failure of independent portions of more than one train or channel in the same or different systems is reportable. For example, if a cause or condition caused components in train A and B of a single system to become inoperable, even if additional trains (e.g., train C) were still available, the event must be reported. In addition, if the cause or condition caused components in train A of one system and in train B of another system (i.e., the train that is assumed in the safety analysis to be independent) to become inoperable, the event must be reported. However, if a cause or condition caused components in train A of one system and train A of another system (i.e., trains that are not assumed in the safety analysis to be independent), the event need not be reported unless it meets one or more of the other reporting criteria. Trains or channels, for reportability purposes, are defined as those redundant, independent trains or channels designed to provide protection against single failures. Many engineered safety systems containing active components are designed with at least a two-train system. Each independent train in a two-train system can normally satisfy all of the safety system requirements to safely shut down the plant or satisfy those criteria that have to be met following an accident. ----- page_no: 59 This criterion does not include those cases in which one train of a system or a component was removed from service as part of a planned evolution, in accordance with an approved procedure, and in accordance with the plant's TS. For example, if the licensee removes part of a system from service to perform maintenance, and the TS permit the resulting configuration, and the system or component is returned to service within the time limit specified in the TS, the action need not be reported under this paragraph. However, if, while the train or component is out of service, the licensee identifies a condition that could have prevented the whole system from performing its intended function (e.g., the licensee finds a set of relays that is wired incorrectly), that condition must be reported. Analysis of events reported under this part of the rule may identify previously unrecognized common cause (or dependent) failures and system interactions. Such failures can be simultaneous failures that occur because of a single initiating cause (i.e., the single cause or mechanism serves as a common input to the failures), or the failures can be sequential (i.e., cascading failures), such as the case in which a single component failure results in the failure of one or more additional components.",

The licensee found that the solenoid-operated valves on all 16 MSIVs\nwere damaged. The three-way and four-way valves and solenoid pilot valves on all 16\nMSIVs had a hardened, sticky substance in their ports and on their O-rings. As a result,\nmotion of all the solenoid-operated valves was impaired, resulting in instrument air\nleakage and the inability to operate all of the MSIVs satisfactorily. The licensee also\nexamined unused spares in the warehouse and found that the lubricant had dried out in\nthose valves, leaving a residue. Several of the warehouse spares were bench tested.\nThey were found to be degraded and also leaked. The root cause of the event was use\nof an incorrect lubricant.\n\nThe event is reportable (1) because a single cause or condition caused multiple\nindependent trains of the main steam isolation system (a system designed to control the\nrelease of radioactive material and mitigate the consequences of an accident) to become\ninoperable (10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)(C) and (D)), and (2) because a single condition\ncould have prevented fulfillment of a safety function (10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v))."

        "Discussion": "These criteria pertain to internal threats. The criterion for external threats, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iii), is described in Section 3.2.5 of this report. This provision requires reporting events, particularly those caused by acts of personnel, that endanger the safety of the plant or interfere with personnel in the performance of duties necessary for safe plant operations. The licensee must exercise some judgment in reporting under this rule. For example, a small fire on site that did not endanger any plant equipment and did not and could not reasonably be expected to endanger the plant is not reportable. ----- page_no: 63 The phrase \"significantly hampers site personnel\" applies narrowly; i.e., only to those events that significantly hamper the ability of site personnel to perform safety-related activities affecting plant safety. In addition, the staff considers the following standards appropriate in this regard: . The significant hampering criterion is pertinent to \"the performance of duties necessary for safe operation of the nuclear power plant.\" One way to evaluate this is to ask if one could seal the room in question (or disable the function in question) for a substantial period of time and still operate the plant safely. For example, if a switchgear room is unavailable for a time, but it is normally not necessary to enter the room for safe operation, and no need to enter the room arises while it is unavailable, the event is not reportable under this criterion. · Significant hampering includes hindering or interfering, provided that the interference or delay is sufficient to significantly threaten the safe operation of the plant. . Actions such as room evacuations that are precautionary would not constitute significant hampering if the necessary actions can still be performed in a timely manner. Plant mode may be considered in determining if there is an actual internal threat to a plant. However, licensees should not incorrectly assume that everything that happens while a plant is shut down is unimportant and not reportable. In-plant releases must be reported if they require evacuation of rooms or buildings and, as a result, the ability of the operators to perform duties necessary for safe operation of the plant is significantly hampered. Events such as minor spills, small gaseous waste releases, or the disturbance of contaminated particulate matter (e.g., dust) that require temporary evacuation of an individual room until the airborne concentrations decrease or until respiratory protection devices are used, are not reportable unless the ability of site personnel to perform necessary safety functions is significantly hampered. No LER is required for precautionary evacuations of rooms and buildings that subsequent evaluation determines were not required. Even if an evacuation affects a major part of the facility, the test for reportability is whether an actual threat to plant safety occurred or whether site personnel were significantly hampered in carrying out their safety responsibilities. In most cases, fires result in an ENS notification because there is a declaration of an emergency class, which is reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(a)(1)(i) as discussed in Section 3.1.1 of this report.9 If there is an actual threat or significant hampering, an LER is also required. With 9 As indicated in NUREG-0654, Revision 1, IN 88-64, \"Reporting Fires in Nuclear Process Systems at Nuclear Power Plants,\" dated August 18, 1988, and Regulatory Guide 1.101, Revision 3, \"Emergency Planning and Preparedness for Nuclear Power Reactors,\" issued August 1992 (which endorses NUMARC/NESP-007, Revision 2), a fire that lasts longer than 10 or 15 minutes or that affects plant equipment important for safe operation would result in declaration of an emergency class. ----- page_no: 64 regard to control room fires, the staff generally considers a control room fire to constitute an actual threat and significant hampering. 10",

The NRC Operations Center does ----- page_no: 66 not need to be made aware of every press release made by a licensee. The following clarifications are intended to set a reporting threshold that ensures necessary reporting while minimizing unnecessary reporting. Examples of events likely to be reportable under this criterion include the following: · release of radioactively contaminated tools or equipment to public areas · unusual or abnormal releases of radioactive effluents . onsite fatality Licensees generally do not have to report media and government interactions unless they are related to the radiological health and safety of the public or onsite personnel, or protection of the environment. For example, the NRC does not generally need to be informed under this criterion of the following: · minor deviations from sewage or chlorine effluent limits . minor nonradioactive, onsite chemical spills . minor oil spills · problems with plant stack or water tower aviation lighting · peaceful demonstrations · routine reports of effluent releases to other agencies . releases of water from dams associated with the plant For events or situations related to the health and safety of the public or onsite personnel, or to protection of the environment, licensees are required to notify the NRC within 4 hours of whichever of the following occurs first: . a plan to report to either the press or another government agency is approved by an individual authorized to make the final decision . a report has actually been made to the press or another government agency #### Press Release The NRC has an obligation to inform the public about issues within the NRC's purview that affect or raise a concern about the public health and safety. Thus, the NRC needs accurate, detailed information in a timely manner regarding such situations. The NRC should be aware of information that is available for the press or other government agencies. However, the NRC need not be notified of every press release a licensee issues. The field of NRC interest is narrowed by the phrase \"related to the health and safety of the public or onsite personnel, or protection of the environment\" in order to exclude administrative matters or those events of no significance. Routine radiation releases are not specifically reportable under this criterion. However, if a release receives media attention, the release is reportable under this criterion. If possible, licensees should make an ENS notification before issuing a press release because news media representatives will usually contact the NRC public affairs officer shortly after its issuance for verification, explanation, or interpretation of the facts. ----- page_no: 67 #### Other Government Notifications For reporting purposes, \"other government agencies\" refers to local, State, or other Federal agencies. Notifying another Federal agency does not relieve the licensee of the requirement to report to the NRC. Some plants provide a State incident response facility with alarm indication coincident with control room alarms; e.g., an effluent radiation monitor alarm. However, an alarm received at a State facility is in itself not a requirement for notifying the NRC under this criterion. A release is reportable under this criterion if a press release is planned or a specific report (beyond the automatic alarm indication) has been or will be made to a State agency.",

For example, the loss of the SPDS alone may not need to be reported, but a loss of the SPDS concurrent with other plant indicators or annunciators being unavailable is reportable if the licensee would be unable to assess or monitor an accident or transient in progress. Examples of events that should be evaluated against this threshold for reportability include, but are not limited to: · A loss of a significant portion of control room indication, including annunciators or monitors, or the loss of all plant vent stack radiation monitors, should be evaluated for reportability. In evaluating the reportability of such events, only those display systems, indicators, and annunciators that are relied upon in the emergency plan and the emergency plan implementing procedures addressing classification, assessment, or protective actions; or relied upon in other station procedures that provide input to these activities need to be considered. The indication remaining available should be considered in determining if a major loss of emergency assessment capability has occurred. · A significant degradation in the licensee's ability to perform accident assessment functions assigned to a licensee primary ERF by the emergency plan. Typically, these functions would be the technical support center (TSC) but may include the emergency operations facility (EOF). Degradations would not be reportable if the ERF's assessment capabilities were restored to service within the facility activation times specified in the emergency plan. Planned maintenance which impacts the accident assessment functions of the ERF, or its supporting systems, need not be reported if (1) the ERF's assessment capabilities could be restored to service within the facility acitivation time specified in the emergency plan in the event of an accident or the licensee had implemented viable compensatory actions,11 and (2) the planned outage is not expected to, and subsequently did not, exceed 72 hours. #### Loss of Offsite Response Capability A major loss of offsite response capability includes those events that would significantly impair the ability of the licensee or offsite officials to implement the functions of their respective emergency plans if an emergency were to occur. Examples of events that should be evaluated against this threshold for reportability include, but are not limited to: · The occurrence of a significant natural hazard (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, major winter storms) or other event that would do one or both of the following: 11 \"Promptly\" means within the licensee's emergency plan requirements for facility activation time. A \"viable\" compensatory action is one that (1) can restore the required function in a reasonably comparable manner and (2) is proceduralized prior to an event. ----- page_no: 71 – Prevent State and local jurisdictions from maintaining evacuation routes passable, or from maintaining other parts of the response infrastructure available, to the extent that these jurisdictions would be unable to implement the public protective measures called for in their emergency plan, if known by the licensee, or, \\- Restrict access to the licensee's site, or its offsite primary EOFs, such that the licensee would not be able to augment its on-shift staff or activate its ERFs as required by the emergency plan. Offsite response support relied upon in the emergency plan, such as fire departments, local law enforcement, and ambulance services, would not be able to access the site. Traffic impediments, such as fog, snow, and ice, should generally not be reported if they are within the respective capabilities of the licensee, State, or local officials to resolve or mitigate. Rather, the reporting requirement is intended to apply to more significant cases, such as the conditions around the Turkey Point plant after Hurricane Andrew struck in 1992 or the conditions around the Cooper station during the Midwest floods of 1993. · Failures in the primary public alerting systems (e.g., sirens, tone alert radios), for whatever reason, that result in the loss of the capability to alert a large segment of the population in the emergency planning zone (EPZ) for more than 1 hour. The licensee should take reasonable measures to remain informed of the status of the primary public alerting system, regardless of who maintains the system, and must notify the NRC if the established thresholds are exceeded. A planned outage of the primary public alerting system need not be reported if (1) the licensee had arranged for the implementation of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-approved backup alerting methods should public alerting become necessary, and (2) the planned outage is not expected to, and subsequently did not, exceed 24 hours. ##### Loss of Communications Capability A major loss of communications capability include those events that would significantly impair the ability of the licensee to implement the functions of its emergency plans if an emergency were to occur. Failures of individual communications systems are reportable only to the extent that these failures meet this threshold. The failure of a single communication system need not be reported if there are viable alternative methods12 of communicating information about the emergency. This reporting requirement only addresses those communication systems that enable a licensee to make notifications and provide followup information to Federal, State, and local officials located offsite. It also includes communication capabilities between the site and licensee ERO personnel assigned offsite. Examples of communication systems whose failures should be evaluated against the above threshold for reportability include, but are not limited to, the following: ###### . ERDS 12 A \"viable\" alternative method (or compensatory action) is one that (1) can perform the required function in a reasonably comparable manner and (2) is proceduralized prior to an event. ----- page_no: 72 · ENS · health physics network (HPN) · other offsite communication systems, including the following: \\- dedicated telephone communication link to State or local officials \\- dedicated voice and data links between the site and emergency offsite response facilities \\- licensee radio system for communicating with offsite field monitoring teams \\- commercial telephone lines that are relied upon for use in emergency response Each site's communications system will be different, and the significance of the loss of any one communication system may differ from site to site. This reporting requirement is intended to apply to serious conditions during which the telecommunications system can no longer fulfill the communications requirements of the emergency plan. Planned maintenance that impacts the emergency communications capability need not be reported if (1) the communication system could be restored to service promptly in the event of an accident or the licensee had implemented viable compensatory actions, 13 and (2) the planned outage is not expected to, and subsequently did not, exceed 72 hours. Although a notification may not be required under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3(xiii) in the event of a loss of the ENS, HPN, or ERDS because of the availability of viable alternative communication means, the licensee should inform the NRC Operations Center of any failure of these systems so that the NRC may arrange for repair of NRC-supplied communications equipment. When informing the NRC Operations Center, licensees should use the commercial telephone number 301-816-5100. If the Operations Center (or the ERDS Data Center) notifies the licensee that an ENS, HPN, or ERDS line is out of service, there is no need for an additional call. At the time the failure is reported, the licensee should be prepared to supply the following information to expedite repair: (1) name of contact at location of failure, (2) commercial phone number of contact, (3) location of contact (i.e., street address, building number, room number, etc., and (4) any other information that would expedite repair.",

        "Discussion": "The level of judgment for reporting an event or condition under this criterion is a reasonable expectation of preventing fulfillment of a safety function. In the discussions that follow, several different expressions, such as \"would have,\" \"could have,\" \"alone could have,\" and \"reasonable doubt,\" are used to characterize this standard. In the staff's view, all of these should be judged on the basis of a reasonable expectation of preventing fulfillment of the safety function. For trains or channels that have been declared inoperable, the capability is considered degraded to a point where it cannot perform with reasonable expectation or reliability. As a result, subject to the exceptions stated in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ix)(B)(1) and (2), for trains or channels within the scope of this criterion, a report is required when there is a determination that two or more trains or channels in different systems are inoperable as a result of a single cause while in a required mode or other specified condition in the TS Applicability. However, reports are not required when trains or channels in different systems are declared inoperable as part of a planned evolution for maintenance or surveillance testing when done in accordance with an approved procedure and the plant's TS (unless a condition is discovered that would have resulted in the trains or channels in different systems being declared inoperable as a result of a single cause). For guidance on determining whether a train or channel is operable, see RIS 2005-20, Revision 1. Operable but nonconforming or degraded conditions are not considered reportable under this criterion. The intent of this criterion is to capture those events in which, as a result of a single cause, there would have been a failure of two or more trains or channels to properly complete their safety function, regardless of whether there was an actual demand. For example, if, as a result of a single cause, a train of the HPSI system and a train of the AFW system failed, the event would be reportable even if there was no demand for the systems' safety functions. Examples of a single cause responsible for a reportable event may include cases of procedural error, equipment failure, or discovery of a design, analysis, fabrication, construction, or procedural inadequacy. They may also include such factors as high ambient temperatures, heatup from energization, inadequate preventive maintenance, oil contamination of air systems, incorrect lubrication, or use of nonqualified components. The event is reportable if, as a result of a single cause, two or more trains or channels are inoperable, regardless of whether the problem was discovered in both trains at the same time. Trains or channels, for reportability purposes, are defined as those trains or channels designed to provide protection against single failures. Many systems containing active components are designed as at least a two-train system. Each train in a two-train system can normally satisfy all of the system functions. SSCs within scope include only safety-related SSCs required by the TS to be operable that are intended to mitigate the consequences of an accident as discussed in Chapters 6 and 15 of the FSAR (or equivalent chapters). Accidents are identified as events of moderate frequency, infrequent incidents, or limiting faults as discussed in Regulatory Guide 1.70 (or equivalent classifications of the three types of events). ANS categorizes these events as Condition II, III and IV type events. ----- page_no: 76",

The same\ninadequate material had been installed in a similar valve in a different system at the\nsame time. The similar valve was exposed to similar environmental conditions as the\nfirst valve.\n\nThe condition is reportable under this criterion if engineering judgment indicates that\nthere was a reasonable expectation of preventing fulfillment of the safety function of both\naffected trains.

The intent is to require licensees to make and act on reportability\ndecisions in a timely manner so that ENS notifications are made to the NRC as soon as\npractical, keeping in mind the safety of the plant. See Section 2.5 for further discussion of\nreporting timeliness.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"69\" -->\n\n ----- page_no: 82\n\n#### 4.2.2 Voluntary Notifications\n\nLicensees may make voluntary or courtesy ENS notifications about events or conditions in\nwhich the NRC may be interested. The NRC responds to any voluntary notification of an event\nor condition as its safety significance warrants, regardless of the licensee's classification of the\nreporting requirement. If it is determined later that the event is reportable, the licensee can\nchange the ENS notification to a required notification under the appropriate 10 CFR 50.72\nreporting criterion.\n\n\n#### 4.2.3 ENS Notification Retraction\n\nIf a licensee makes a 10 CFR 50.72 ENS notification and later determines that the event or\ncondition was not reportable, the licensee should call the NRC Operations Center on the ENS\ntelephone to retract the notification and explain the rationale for that decision. There is no set\ntime limit for ENS telephone retractions. However, because most retractions occur following\ncompletion of engineering and/or management review, it is expected that retractions would\noccur shortly after such review. A retracted ENS report is retained in the ENS database, along\nwith the retraction. See Section 2.8 for further discussion of retractions.\n\n\n#### 4.2.4 ENS Event Notification Worksheet (NRC Form 361)\n\nThe ENS \"Event Notification Worksheet\" (NRC Form 361) provides the usual order of questions\nand discussion for easier communication and its use often enables a licensee to prepare\nanswers for a more clear and complete notification. A clear ENS notification helps the HOO to\nunderstand the safety significance of the event. Licensees may obtain an event number and\nnotification time from the HOO when the ENS notification is made. If an LER is required, the\nlicensee may include this information in the LER to provide a cross-reference to the ENS\nnotification, making the event easier to trace.\n\nLicensees should use proper names for systems and components, as well as their\nalphanumeric identifications, during ENS notifications. Licensees should avoid using local\njargon for plant components, areas, operations, and the like so that the HOO can quickly\nunderstand the situation and have fewer questions. In addition, others not familiar with the plant\ncan more readily understand the situation.\n\nElectronic versions of NRC Form 361 are available at the NRC public Web site at\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/forms/.\n\n\n### 4.3 Typical ENS Reporting Issues\n\nAt the time of an ENS notification, the NRC must independently assess the status of the reactor\nto determine if it is in a safe condition and expected to remain so. The HOO needs to\nunderstand the safety significance of each event to brief NRC management or initiate an NRC\nresponse. The HOO will be primarily concerned about the safety significance of the event, the\ncurrent condition of the plant, and the possible near-term effects the event could have on plant\nsafety. The HOO will attempt to obtain as complete a description as is available at the time of\nthe notification of the event or condition, its causes, and its effects. Depending on the licensee's\ndescription of the event, the HOO may be concerned about other related issues. The questions\nthat licensees typically may be asked to discuss do not represent a requirement for reporting.\nThese questions are of a nature to allow the HOO information to more fully understand the\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"70\" -->\n\n ----- page_no: 83\n\nevent and its safety significance and are not meant in any way to distract the licensee from\nmore important issues.\n\nThe licensee's first responsibility during a transient is to stabilize the plant and keep it safe.\nHowever, licensees should not delay in declaring an emergency class when conditions warrant\nbecause delaying the declaration can defeat the appropriate response to an emergency.\nBecause of the safety significance of a declared emergency, time is of the essence. The NRC\nneeds to become aware of the situation as soon as practical to activate the NRC Operations\nCenter and the appropriate NRC regional incident response center, as necessary, and to notify\nother Federal agencies.\n\nThe effectiveness of the NRC response during an event depends largely on complete and\naccurate reporting from the licensee. During an emergency, the appropriate regional incident\nresponse center and the NRC Operations Center become focal points for NRC action. Licensee\nactions during an emergency are monitored by the NRC to ensure that appropriate action is\nbeing taken to protect the health and safety of the public. When required, the NRC supports the\nlicensee with technical analysis and coordinates logistics support. The NRC keeps other\nFederal agencies informed of the status of an incident and provides information to the media. In\naddition, the NRC assesses and, if necessary, confirms the appropriateness of actions\nrecommended by the licensee to local and State authorities.\n\nIN 85-80 indicates that it is the licensee's responsibility to ensure that adequate personnel,\nknowledgeable about plant conditions and emergency plan implementing procedures, are\navailable on shift to assist the shift supervisor to classify an emergency and activate the\nemergency plan, including making appropriate notifications, without interfering with plant\noperation. When 10 CFR 50.72 was published, the NRC made clear its intent in the Statements\nof Consideration that notifications on the ENS to the NRC Operations Center should be made\nby those knowledgeable of the event. If the description of any emergency is to be sufficiently\naccurate and timely to meet the intent of the NRC's regulations, the personnel responsible for\nnotification must be properly trained and sufficiently knowledgeable of the event to report it\ncorrectly. The NRC did not intend that notifications made under 10 CFR 50.72 would be made\nby those who did not understand the event that they are reporting.\n\nENS reportability evaluations should be concluded and the ENS notification made as soon as\npractical and in all cases within 1, 4, or 8 hours to meet 10 CFR 50.72. The Statements of\nConsideration noted that the 1-hour deadline is necessary if the NRC is to fulfill its\nresponsibilities during and following the most serious events occurring at operating nuclear\npower plants without interfering with the operator's ability to deal with an accident or transient in\nthe first few critical minutes (48 FR 39041; August 29, 1983).\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"71\" -->\n\n ----- page_no: 84\n\n\n\n ----- page_no: 85\n\n## 5. LICENSEE EVENT REPORTS\n\nThis section discusses the guidelines for preparing and submitting LERs. Section 5.1\naddresses administrative requirements and provides guidelines for submittal; Section 5.2\naddresses the requirements and guidelines for the LER content. Portions of the rule are\nquoted, followed by explanation, if necessary. Copies of the required \"Licensee Event Report\"\nform (NRC Form 366), \"Licensee Event Report (LER) Continuation Sheet\" (NRC Form 366A),\nand \"Licensee Event Report (LER) Failure Continuation\" form (NRC Form 366B) may be found\nat the NRC public Web site at http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/forms/.\n\n\n### 5.1 LER Reporting Guidelines\n\nThis section addresses administrative requirements and provides guidelines for submittal.\nTopics addressed include submission of reports, forwarding letters, cancellation of LERs, report\nlegibility, reports other than LERs that use LER forms, supplemental information, revised\nreports, and general instructions for completing LER forms.\n\n\n#### 5.1.1 Submission of LERs\n\n§ 50.73(d)\n\n\"Submission of reports. Licensee Event Reports must be prepared on\nForm NRC 366 and submitted to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, as\nspecified in § 50.4.\"\n\nAn LER is to be submitted (mailed) within 60 days of the discovery date. If a 60-day period\nends on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, reports submitted on the first working day following the\nend of the 60 days are acceptable. If a licensee knows that a report will be late or needs an\nadditional day or so to complete the report, the situation should be discussed with the\nappropriate NRC regional office. See Section 2.5 for further discussion of discovery date.\n\n\n#### 5.1.2 LER Forwarding Letter and Cancellations\n\nThe cover letter forwarding an LER to the NRC should be signed by a responsible official.\nThere is no prescribed format for the letter. The date the letter is issued and the report date\nshould be the same. Licensees are encouraged to include the NRC resident inspector and the\nInstitute of Nuclear Power Operations in their distribution. Multiple LERs can be forwarded by\none forwarding letter.\n\nCancellations of LERs submitted should be made by letter. The letter should state that the LER\nis being canceled (i.e., formally withdrawn). The bases for the cancellation should be explained\nso that the staff can understand and review the reasons supporting the determination. The\nnotice of cancellation will be filed and stored with the LER and acknowledgement made in\nvarious automated data systems. The LER will be removed from the LER database.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"73\" -->\n\n ----- page_no: 86\n\n#### 5.1.3 Report Legibility\n\n§ 50.73(e)\n\n\"The reports and copies that licensees are required to submit to the Commission\nunder the provisions of this section must be of sufficient quality to permit legible\nreproduction and micrographic processing.\"\n\nNo further explanation is necessary.\n\n\n### 5.1.4 Voluntary LERs\n\nIndicate information-type LERS (i.e., voluntary LERs) by checking the \"Other\" block in Item 11 of\nthe LER form and type \"Voluntary Report\" in the space immediately below the block. Also give\na sequential LER number to the voluntary report as noted in Section 5.2.7(6). Because not all\nrequirements of 10 CFR 50.73(b), \"Contents,\" may pertain to some voluntary reports, licensees\nshould develop the content of such reports to best present the information associated with the\nsituation being reported.\n\nSee Section 2.7 for additional discussion of voluntary LERs.\n\n\n### 5.1.5 Supplemental Information and Revised LERs\n\n§ 50.73(c)\n\n\"The Commission may require the licensee to submit specific additional information\nbeyond that required by paragraph (b) of this section if the Commission finds that\nsupplemental material is necessary for complete understanding of any unusually\ncomplex or significant event. These requests for supplemental information will be\nmade in writing and the licensee shall submit, as specified in § 50.4, the requested\ninformation as a supplement to the initial LER.\"\n\nThis provision authorizes the NRC staff to require the licensee to submit specific supplemental\ninformation.\n\nIf an LER is incomplete at the time of original submittal or if it contains significant incorrect\ninformation of a technical nature, the licensee should use a revised report to provide the\nadditional information or to correct technical errors discovered in the LER. Identify the revision\nto the original LER in the LER number as described in Section 5.2.7, Item (6).\n\nThe revision should be complete and should not contain only supplementary or revised\ninformation to the previous LER, because the revised LER will replace the previous report in the\ncomputer file. In addition, indicate in the text on the LER form the revised or supplementary\ninformation by placing a vertical line in the margin. If an LER mentions that an engineering\nstudy was being conducted, report the results of the study in a revised LER only if it would\nsignificantly change the reader's perception of the course, significance, implications, or\nconsequences of the event or if it results in substantial changes in the corrective action planned\nby the licensee.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"74\" -->\n\n ----- page_no: 87\n\nUse revisions only to provide additional or corrected information about a reported event. Do not\nuse a revision to report subsequent failures of the same or like component, except as permitted\nin 10 CFR 50.73. Some licensees have incorrectly used revisions to report new events that\nwere discovered months after the original event because they were loosely related to the\noriginal event. These revisions had different event dates and discussed new, although similar,\nevents. Report events of this type as new LERs and not as revisions to previous LERs.\n\n\n### 5.1.6 Special Reports\n\nThere are a number of requirements in various sections of the TS that require reporting of\noperating experience that is not covered by 10 CFR 50.73. If LER forms are used to submit\nspecial reports, check the \"Other\" block in Item 11 of the form and type \"Special Report\" in the\nspace immediately below the block. The provisions of 10 CFR 50.73(b) may not be applicable\nor appropriate in a special report. Develop the content of the report to best present the\ninformation associated with the situation being reported. In addition, if the LER form is used to\nsubmit a special report, use a report number from the sequence used for LERs.\n\nIf an event is reportable both under 10 CFR 50.73 and as a special report, check the block in\nItem 11 for the applicable section of 10 CFR 50.73 as well as the \"Other\" block for a special\nreport. The content of the report should depend on the reportable situation.\n\n\n### 5.1.7 Appendix J Reports (Containment Leak Rate Test Reports)\n\nA licensee must perform containment integrated and local leak rate testing and report the\nresults as required by Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50. When the leak rate test identifies a\nsituation reportable under 10 CFR 50.73 (see Section 3.2.4 of this report), submit an LER and\ninclude the results in a report under Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 by reference, if desired. The\nLER should address only the reportable situation, not the entire leak rate test.\n\n\n### 5.1.8 10 CFR 73.71 Reports\n\nSubmit events or conditions that are reportable under 10 CFR 73.71, \"Maintenance of Records,\nMaking of Reports,\" using the LER forms with the appropriate blocks in Item 11 checked. If the\nreport contains Safeguards Information as defined in 10 CFR 73.21, \"Protection of Safeguards\nInformation: Performance Requirements,\" the LER forms may still be used but should be\nappropriately marked in accordance with 10 CFR 73.21. Include safeguards and security\ninformation only in the narrative and not in the abstract. In addition, the text should clearly\nindicate the information that is safeguards or security information. Finally, the requirements of\n10 CFR 73.21(g) must be met when transmitting Safeguards Information. For additional\nguidelines on 10 CFR 73.71 reporting, see Regulatory Guide 5.62, Revision 1, \"Reporting of\nSafeguards Events,\" issued November 1987; NUREG-1304, \"Reporting of Safeguards Events,\"\nissued February 1988; and Generic Letter 91-03, \"Reporting of Safeguards Events,\" dated\nMarch 6, 1991.\n\nIf the LER contains proprietary information, mark it appropriately in Item 17 (text) on the LER\nform. Include proprietary information only in the narrative and not in the abstract. In addition,\nindicate clearly in the narrative the information that is proprietary. Finally, the requirements of\n10 CFR 2.790(b) must be met when transmitting proprietary information.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"75\" -->\n\n ----- page_no: 88\n\n### 5.1.9 Availability of LER Forms\n\nThe NRC will provide LER forms (i.e., NRC Forms 366, 366A, and 366B) free of charge.\nCopies may be obtained by writing to the NRC Records Management Branch, Office of the\nChief Information Officer, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555.\n\nElectronic versions are also available at the NRC public Web site at\nhttp://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/forms/.\n\n\n### 5.2 LER Content Requirements and Preparation Guidance\n\n\n#### 5.2.1 Optical Character Reader\n\nTo help reduce the number of errors incurred by the optical character reader used to read LER\ncontents into NRC databases, the NRC suggests the following practices.\n\nThe staff suggests that you do not use underscore, do not use bold print, do not use italic print\nstyle, do not end any lines with a hyphen, and do not use paragraph indents. Instead, print copy\nsingle spaced, with a blank line between paragraphs.\n\nThe following are limitations on the use of symbols in the textual areas:\n\n· Spell out the word \"degree.\"\n\n· Use </= for \"less than or equal to.\"\n\n· Use >/= for \"greater than or equal to.\"\n\n· Use +/- for \"plus or minus.\"\n\n· Spell out all Greek letters.\n\nDo not use exponents. A number should be either expressed as a decimal, spelled out, or,\npreferably, designated in terms of \"E\" (E field format). For example, 4.2x10-6 could be\nexpressed as 4.2E-6, 0.0000042 or 4.2 x 10(-6).\n\nDefine all abbreviations and acronyms in both the text and the abstract and explain all\ncomponent designators the first time they are used (e.g., the ESW pump 1-SW-P-1A).\n\n\n#### 5.2.2 Narrative Description or Text (NRC Form 366A, Item 17)"

After the narrative is written, however, review the appropriate sections of\n10 CFR 50.73(b) to make sure that applicable subjects have been adequately addressed. It is\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"76\" -->\n\n ----- page_no: 89\n\nhelpful to use headings to improve readability. For example, some LERs employ major\nheadings such as event description, safety consequences, corrective actions, and previous\nsimilar events and subheadings such as initial conditions, dates and times, event classification,\nsystems status, event or condition causes, failure modes, method of discovery, component\ninformation, immediate corrective actions, and actions to prevent recurrence.\n\nExplain exactly what happened during the entire event or condition, including how systems,\ncomponents, and operating personnel performed. Do not cover specific hardware problems in\nexcessive detail. Describe unique characteristics of a plant as well as other characteristics that\ninfluenced the event (favorably or unfavorably). Avoid using plant-unique terms and\nabbreviations, or, as a minimum, clearly define them. The audience for LERs is large and does\nnot necessarily know the details of each plant.\n\nInclude the root causes, the plant status before the event, and the sequence of occurrences.\nDescribe the event from the perspective of the operator (i.e., what the operator saw, did,\nperceived, understood, or misunderstood). Specific information that should be included, as\nappropriate, is described in 10 CFR 50.73(b)(2)(ii), (b)(3), (b)(4), and (b)(5) and separately in\nthe following sections.\n\nIf several systems actuate during an event, describe all aspects of the complete event, including\nall actuations sequentially, and those aspects that by themselves would not be reportable. For\nexample, if a single component failure (generally not reportable) occurs following a reactor\nscram (reportable), describe the component failure in the narrative of the LER for the reactor\nscram. It is necessary to discuss the performance and status of equipment important for\ndefining and understanding what happened and for determining the potential implications of the\nevent.\n\nParaphrase pertinent sections of the latest submitted FSAR rather than referencing them\nbecause not all organizations or individuals have access to FSARs. Extensive cross-\nreferencing would be excessively time consuming, considering the large number of LERs and\nlarge number of reviewers that read each LER. Ensure that each applicable component's\nsafety-significant effect on the event or condition is clearly and completely described.\n\nDo not use statements such as \"this event is not significant with respect to the health and safety\nof the public\" without explaining the basis for the conclusion.\n\n\n## § 50.73(b)(2)(ii)(A)\n\nThe narrative description must include the following: \"Plant operating conditions\nbefore the event.\"\n\nDescribe the plant operating conditions such as power level or, if not at power, describe the\nmode, temperature, and pressure that existed before the event.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"77\" -->\n\n ----- page_no: 90\n\n## § 50.73(b)(2)(ii)(B)\n\nThe narrative description must include the following: \"Status of structures,\ncomponents, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event and that\ncontributed to the event.\"\n\nIf there were no SSCs that were inoperable at the start of the event and contributed to the\nevent, so state. Otherwise, identify SSCs that were inoperable and contributed to the initiation\nor limited the mitigation of the event. This should include alternative mitigating SSCs that are a\npart of normal or emergency operating procedures that were or could have been used to\nmitigate, reduce the consequences of, or limit the safety implications of the event. Include the\nimpact of support systems on mitigating systems that could have been used.\n\n\n## § 50.73(b)(2)(ii)(C)\n\nThe narrative description must include the following: \"Dates and approximate times of\noccurrences.\"\n\nFor a transient or system actuation event, the event date and time are the date and time that the\nevent actually occurred. If the event is a discovered condition for which the occurrence date is\nnot known, the event date should be specified as the discovery date. However, a discussion of\nthe best estimate of the event date and its basis should be provided in the narrative. For\nexample, if a design deficiency was identified on March 27, 1997, that involved a component\ninstalled during refueling in the spring of 1986, and only the discovery date is known with\ncertainty, the event date should be specified as the discovery date. A discussion should be\nprovided that describes, based on the best information available, the most likely time that the\ndesign flaw was introduced into the component (e.g., by the manufacturer or by plant\nengineering prior to procurement). The length of time that the component was in service should\nalso be provided (i.e., when it was installed).\n\nDiscuss both the discovery date and the event date if they differ. If an LER is not submitted\nwithin 60 days from the event date, explain the relationship between the event date, discovery\ndate, and report date in the narrative. See Section 2.5 for further discussion of discovery date.\n\nGive dates and approximate times for all major occurrences discussed in the LER\n(e.g., discoveries; immediate corrective actions; systems, components, or trains declared\ninoperable or operable; reactor trip; actuation and termination of equipment operation; and\nstable conditions achieved). In particular, for standby pumps and emergency generators,\nindicate the length of time of operation and any intermittent periods of shutdown or inoperability\nduring the event. Include an estimate of the time and date of failure of systems, components, or\ntrains if different from the time and date of discovery. A chronology may be used to clarify the\ntiming of personnel and equipment actions.\n\nFor equipment that was inoperable at the start of the event, provide an estimate of the time the\nequipment became inoperable and the last time the equipment was demonstrated to be capable\nof performing its safety function. The licensee should provide the basis for this conclusion\n(e.g., a test was successfully run or the equipment was operating). For equipment that failed,\nprovide the failure time and the last time the equipment was demonstrated to be capable of\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"78\" -->\n\n ----- page_no: 91\n\nperforming its safety function. The licensee should provide the basis for this conclusion (e.g., a\ntest was performed or the equipment was operating).\n\nComponents such as valves and snubbers may be tested over a period of several weeks.\nDuring this period, a number of inoperable similar components may be discovered.16 In such\ncases, similar failures that are reportable and that are discovered during a single test program\nwithin the 60 days of discovery of the first failure may be reported as one LER. For similar\nfailures that are reportable under 10 CFR 50.73 criteria and that are discovered during a single\ntest program or activity, report all failures that occurred within the first 60 days of discovery of\nthe first failure on one LER. However, the 60-day clock starts when the first reportable event is\ndiscovered. State in the LER text (and code the information in Items 14 and 15) that a\nsupplement to the LER will be submitted when the test is completed. Submit a revision to the\noriginal LER when the test is completed. Include all of the failures, including those reported in\nthe original LER, in the revised LER (i.e., the revised LER should stand alone)."

In those cases, indicate the specific equipment that actuated or\nshould have actuated, by train, compatible with EPIX train definitions (e.g., AFW train B).\nIndicate the mode of operation, such as injecting into the reactor vessel, recirculation, pressure\ncontrol, and any subsequent mode of operation during the event.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"82\" -->\n\n ----- page_no: 95\n\n### 5.2.3 Assessment of Safety Consequences\n\n\n#### § 50.73(b)(3)\n\nThe LER shall contain the following: \"An assessment of the safety consequences and\nimplications of the event. This assessment must include:\n\n(i) The availability of systems or components that could have performed the same\nfunction as the components and systems that failed during the event, and\n\n(ii) For events that occurred when the reactor was shutdown, the availability of\nsystems or components that are needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe\nshutdown conditions, remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material,\nor mitigate the consequences of an accident.\"\n\nGive a summary assessment of the actual and potential safety consequences and implications\nof the event, including the basis for submitting the report. Evaluate the event to the extent\nnecessary to fully assess the safety consequences and safety margins associated with the\nevent.\n\nInclude an assessment of the event under alternative conditions if the incident would have been\nmore severe (e.g., the plant would have been in a condition not analyzed in its latest FSAR)\nunder reasonable and credible alternative conditions, such as a different operating mode. For\nexample, if an event occurred while the plant was at low power and the same event could have\noccurred at full power, which would have resulted in considerably more serious consequences,\nthis alternative condition should be assessed and the consequences reported.\n\nReasonable and credible alternative conditions may include normal plant operating conditions,\npotential accident conditions, or additional component failures, depending on the event. Normal\nalternative operating conditions and off-normal conditions expected to occur during the life of\nthe plant should be considered. The intent of this section is to obtain the result of the\nconsiderations that are typical in the conduct of routine operations, such as event reviews, not\nto require extraordinary studies.\n\nFor events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, discuss the availability of systems or\ncomponents that are needed to shut down the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions,\nremove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the consequences\nof an accident.\n\n\n##### 5.2.4 Corrective Actions\n\n\n## § 50.73(b)(4)\n\nThe LER shall contain the following: \"A description of any corrective actions planned\nas a result of the event, including those to reduce the probability of similar events\noccurring in the future.\"\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"83\" -->\n\n ----- page_no: 96\n\nInclude whether the corrective action was or is planned to be implemented. Discuss repair or\nreplacement actions as well as actions that will reduce the probability of a similar event\noccurring in the future. For example: \"the pump was repaired and a discussion of the event\nwas included in the training lectures.\" Another example: \"although no modification to the\ninstrument was deemed necessary, a caution note was placed in the calibration procedure for\nthe instrument before the step in which the event was initiated.\"\n\nIn addition to a description of any corrective actions planned as a result of the event, describe\ncorrective actions on similar or related components that were done, or are planned, as a direct\nresult of the event. For example, if pump 1 failed during an event and required corrective\nmaintenance and that same maintenance also was done on pump 2, so state.\n\nIf a study was conducted, and results are not available within the 60-day period, report the\nresults of the study in a revised LER if they result in substantial changes in the corrective action\nplanned. (See Section 5.1.5 for further discussion of submitting revised LERs.)\n\n\n### 5.2.5 Previous Occurrences\n\n\n## § 50.73(b)(5)\n\nThe LER shall contain the following: \"Reference to any previous similar events at the\nsame plant that are known to the licensee.\"\n\nThe term \"previous occurrences\" should include previous events or conditions that involved the\nsame underlying concern or reason as this event, such as the same root cause, failure, or\nsequence of events. For infrequent events such as fires, a rather broad interpretation should be\nused (e.g., all fires and, certainly, all fires in the same building should be considered previous\noccurrences). For more frequent events, such as engineered safety feature actuations, a\nnarrower definition may be used (e.g., only those scrams with the same root cause). The intent\nof the rule is to identify generic or recurring problems.\n\nThe licensee should use engineering judgment to decide how far back in time to go to present a\nreasonably complete picture of the current problem. The intent is to be able to see a pattern in\nrecurring events, rather than to get a complete 10- or 20-year history of the system. If the event\nwas a high-frequency type of event, 2 years back may be more than sufficient.\n\nInclude the LER number(s), if any, of previous similar events. Previous similar events are not\nnecessarily limited to events reported in LERs. If no previous similar events are known, so\nstate. If any earlier events, in retrospect, were significant in relation to the subject event,\ndiscuss why prior corrective action did not prevent recurrence.\n\n\n### 5.2.6 Abstract (NRC Form 366, Item 16)\n\n\n## § 50.73(b)(1)\n\nThe LER shall contain the following: \"A brief abstract describing the major\noccurrences during the event, including all component or system failures that\ncontributed to the event and significant corrective action taken or planned to prevent\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"84\" -->\n\n ----- page_no: 97\n\nrecurrence.\"\n\nProvide a brief abstract describing the major occurrences during the event, including all actual\ncomponent or system failures that contributed to the event, all relevant operator errors or\nviolations of procedures, the root cause(s) of the major occurrence(s), and the corrective action\ntaken or planned for each root cause. If space does not permit describing failures, at least\nindicate whether or not failures occurred. Limit the abstract to 1,400 characters (including\nspaces), which is approximately 15 lines of single-spaced typewritten text. Do not use EIIS\ncomponent function identifiers or the two-letter codes for system names in the abstract.\n\nThe abstract is typically included in the LER database to give users a brief description of the\nevent to identify events of interest. Therefore, if space permits, provide the numbers of other\nLERs that reference similar events in the abstract.\n\nAs noted in Section 5.1.8, do not include safeguards, security, or proprietary information in the\nabstract.\n\n\n### 5.2.7 Other Fields on the LER Form\n\n(1) Facility Name (NRC Form 366, Item 1)\n\nEnter the name of the facility (e.g., Indian Point, Unit 1) at which the event occurred. If the\nevent involved more than one unit at a station, enter the name of the nuclear facility with the\nlowest nuclear unit number (e.g., Three Mile Island, Unit 1).\n\n(2) Docket Number (NRC Form 366, Item 2)\n\nEnter the docket number (in 8-digit format) assigned to the unit. For example, the docket\nnumber for Yankee-Rowe is 05000029. Note the use of zeros in this example.\n\n(3) Page Number (NRC Form 366, Item 3)\n\nEnter the total number of pages included (including figures and tables that are attached to\nItem 17 text) in the LER package. For continuation sheets, number the pages consecutively\nbeginning with page 2. The LER form, including the abstract and other data, is prenumbered on\nthe form as page 1 of _.\n\n(4) Title (NRC Form 366, Item 4)\n\nThe title should include a concise description of the principal problem or issue associated with\nthe event, the root cause, the result (why the event was required to be reported), and the link\nbetween them, if possible. It is often easier to form the title after writing the assessment of the\nevent because the information is clearly at hand.\n\n\"Licensee Event Report\" should not be used as a title. The title \"Reactor Trip\" is considered\ninadequate, because the root cause and the link between the root cause and the result are\nmissing. The title \"Personnel Error Causes Reactor Trip\" is considered inadequate because of\nthe innumerable ways in which a person could cause a reactor trip. \"Technician Inadvertently\nInjected Signal Resulting in a Reactor Trip\" would be a better title.\n\n<!-- PageNumber=\"85\" -->\n\n ----- page_no: 98"

ABSTRACT (200 words or less)\n\nNUREG-1022, \"Event Reporting Guidelines: 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73,\" contains guidelines that the staff of the U.S. Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission (NRC) considers acceptable for use in meeting the requirements of Title 10 of the Code of Federal\nRegulations (10 CFR) 50.72 and 50.73. Several identified reporting issues could not be quickly resolved given certain ambiguities in\nNUREG-1022, Revision 2 guidance. In developing Revision 3 to NUREG-1022, the NRC held numerous public and internal\nmeetings to solicit stakeholder inputs and feedback. In resolving the ambiguities, the NRC considered the provisions of the rule\nitself, the associated statements of consideration, and other available guidance in that hierarchal order. Revision 3 to NUREG-1022\nrevises the event reporting guidelines in order to provide clearer guidance.\n\n12\\.
