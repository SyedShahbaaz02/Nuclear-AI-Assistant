        "Description": "2 The licensee should inform State and local offsite response organizations of such events in accordance with the arrangements made between the licensee and offsite organizations. If not reported under 10 CFR 50.72(a) or (b)(1), an ENS notification is required. The initiation of any nuclear plant shutdown required by the plant's Technical Specifications (TS) should be apparent at the time of occurrence. Therefore, if all events are reported properly, it is expected that all reports under 10 CFR 50.72 are as a result of an on-going condition. If the shutdown is completed, an LER is required.",
        "Discussion": "The 10 CFR 50.72 reporting requirement is intended to capture those events for which TS require the initiation of reactor shutdown to provide the NRC with early warning of safety-significant conditions serious enough to warrant that the plant be shut down. For 10 CFR 50.72 reporting purposes, the phrase \"initiation of any nuclear plant shutdown\" includes action to start reducing reactor power; i.e., adding negative reactivity to achieve a nuclear plant shutdown required by TS. This includes initiation of any shutdown due to expected inability to restore equipment prior to exceeding the LCO action time. As a practical matter, in order to meet the time limits for reporting under 10 CFR 50.72, the reporting decision should sometimes be based on such expectations. (See Example 4.) The \"initiation of any nuclear plant shutdown\" does not include mode changes required by TS if they are initiated after the plant is already in a shutdown condition. A reduction in power for some other purpose, not constituting initiation of a shutdown required by TS, is not reportable under this criterion. For 10 CFR 50.73 reporting purposes, the phrase \"completion of any nuclear plant shutdown\" is defined as the point in time during a TS-required shutdown when the plant enters the first shutdown condition required by an LCO (e.g., hot standby (Mode 3) for PWRs with the Standard Technical Specifications (STS)). For example, if at 0200 hours a plant enters an LCO action statement that states, \"restore the inoperable channel to operable status within 12 hours or be in at least Hot Standby within the next 6 hours,\" the plant must be shut down (i.e., at least in hot standby) by 2000 hours. An LER is required if the inoperable channel is not returned to operable status by 2000 hours and the plant enters hot standby. An LER is not required if a failure was or could have been corrected before a plant has completed shutdown (as discussed above) and no other criteria in 10 CFR 50.73 apply.",
        "Examples": "(1) Initiation of a TS-Required Plant Shutdown While operating at 100-percent power, one of the battery chargers, which feeds a 125-volt direct current vital bus, failed during a surveillance test. The battery charger was declared inoperable, placing the plant in a 2-hour LCO to return the battery charger to an operable status or commence a TS-required plant shutdown. Licensee personnel started reducing reactor power to achieve a nuclear plant shutdown required by a TS when they were unable to complete repairs to the inoperable battery charger in the 2 hours allowed. The cause of the battery charger failure was subsequently identified and repaired. Upon completion of surveillance testing, the battery charger was returned to service and the TS-required plant shutdown was stopped at 96-percent power. The licensee made an ENS notification because of the initiation of a TS-required plant shutdown. An LER was not required under this criterion because the failed battery charger was corrected before the plant completed shutdown. #### (2) Initiation and Completion of a TS-Required Plant Shutdown During startup of a PWR plant with reactor power in the intermediate range, two of the four reactor coolant pumps tripped when the station power transformer supplying power de-energized. With less than four reactor coolant pumps operating, the plant entered a 1-hour LCO to be in hot standby. Control rods were manually inserted to place the plant in a shutdown condition. The licensee made an ENS notification because of the initiation of a TS-required plant shutdown. An LER was required because of the completion of the TS-required plant shutdown. (3) Failure that Was or Could Have Been Corrected Before Shutdown Was Required · Question: What about the situation where you have 7 days to fix a component or be shut down, but the plant must be shut down to fix the component? Assume the plant shuts down, the component is fixed, and the plant returns to power before the end of the 7-day period. Is that situation reportable? Answer: No. If the shutdown was not required by the TS, it need not be reported. However, other criteria in 50.73 may apply and may require that the event be reported. · Question: Suppose that there are 7 days to fix a problem, and it is likely that the problem can be fixed during this time period. However, the plant management elects to shut down and fix this problem and other problems. Is an LER required? Answer: No. Some judgment is required. The shutdown is reportable, however, if the situation could not have been corrected before the plant was required to be shut down. (4) Initiation of Plant Shutdown in Anticipation of an LCO-Required Shutdown The plant lost one of two sources of offsite power due to overheating in the main transformer. The TS allow 72 hours to restore the source or initiate a shutdown and be in hot standby within the next 6 hours and cold shutdown within the following 30 hours. The licensee estimated that the transformer problem could not be corrected within the LCO action time. Therefore, the decision was made to start a shutdown soon after the transformer problem was discovered. The shutdown was uneventful and was completed, with the plant in hot standby, before the expiration of the LCO action time. After the plant reached hot standby, further evaluation indicated that the transformer problem could not be corrected before the requirement to place the plant in cold shutdown. Based on this time estimate, it was decided to place the unit in cold shutdown. The event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(i) as the initiation of a plant shutdown required by TS because, at the time the shutdown was initiated and the time the report was due, it was not expected that the equipment would be restored to operable status within the required time. This is based on the fact that the reporting requirement is intended to capture those events for which TS require the initiation of a reactor shutdown. The event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(A) because the plant shutdown was completed when the plant reached hot standby (Mode 3). Had the transformer been repaired and the shutdown process terminated before the plant reached Mode 3, the event would not be reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(A)."

        "Description": "An LER is required for any operation or condition that was prohibited by the plant's TS, subject to the exceptions stated in the rule. The NRC expects licensees to include violations of the TS in their corrective action programs, which are subject to NRC audit.",
        "Discussion": "Safety Limits and Limiting Safety System Settings The regulation in 10 CFR 50.36(c)(1) outlines the reporting requirements in TS for events in which safety limits or limiting safety system settings are exceeded. It indicates that such reports are to be made as required by 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73. There would not be a 3-year limitation in this case because, in addition to the requirements of 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73, specific reporting requirements are stated in 10 CFR 50.36(c)(1), and perhaps in the plant's TS. 3 This criterion does not address violations of license conditions that are contained in documents other than the TS. Such violations are reportable as specified in the plant's license or other applicable documents. #### Limiting Conditions for Operation The regulation in 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) outlines LCOs in TS. Certain TS contain LCO statements that include action statements (required actions and their associated completion time in the STS) to provide constraints on the length of time components or systems may remain inoperable or out of service before the plant must shut down or other compensatory measures must be taken. Such time constraints are based on the safety significance of the component or system being removed from service. An LER is required if a condition existed for a time longer than permitted by the TS (i.e., greater than the total allowed restoration and shutdown outage time (or completion time in the STS)), even if the condition was not discovered until after the allowable time had elapsed and the condition was rectified immediately upon discovery. This guidance is consistent with that previously given. (For the purpose of this discussion, it is assumed that there was firm evidence that a condition prohibited by TS existed before discovery, for a time longer than permitted by TS.) #### Technical Specification Surveillance Testing The regulation in 10 CFR 50.36(c)(3) outlines surveillance requirements in TS that assure (1) the necessary quality of systems and components, (2) operation within safety limits, and (3) meeting the LCOs. Generally, an operation or condition prohibited by the TS existed and is reportable if surveillance testing indicates that equipment (e.g., one train of a multiple-train system) was not capable of performing its specified safety functions (and thus was inoperable) for a period of time longer than allowed by TS (i.e., the LCO-allowed outage time, or the completion time for restoration of equipment in the STS). Reporting is not required if an event consists solely of a case of a late surveillance test in which the oversight is corrected, the test is performed, and the equipment is found to be capable of performing its specified safety functions. For the purpose of evaluating the reportability of a discrepancy found during surveillance testing that is required by the TS, licensees should do the following: (1) For testing that is conducted within the required time (i.e., the surveillance interval plus any extension allowed by STS Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.0.2 or its equivalent), it should be assumed that the discrepancy occurred at the time of its discovery unless there is firm evidence, based on a review of relevant information such as the equipment history and the cause of failure, to indicate that the discrepancy existed previously. (2) For testing that is conducted later than the required time, it should be assumed that the discrepancy occurred at the time the testing was required unless there is firm evidence to indicate that it occurred at a different time. The purpose of this approach is twofold. First, it rules out reporting of routine occurrences (i.e., occurrences for which a timely surveillance test is performed, the results fall outside of acceptable limits, and the condition is corrected) unless there is firm evidence that equipment was incapable of performing its specified safety function longer than allowed. On the other hand, if the surveillance test is performed substantially late, and the equipment is not capable of performing its specified safety function, the occurrence is not routine. In this case, the event is reportable unless there is firm evidence that the duration of the discrepancy was within allowed limits. For cases in which it is discovered that a surveillance test was not performed within its specified frequency or interval, some plants have TS that allow a delay in declaring an LCO or that TS requirements were not met (i.e., STS SR 3.0.3 or its equivalent). This allows time to perform the test before making such a declaration and taking other required actions. However, an LER would still be required if the test indicates that equipment (e.g., one train of a multiple-train system) was not capable of performing its specified safety functions (and thus was inoperable) for a period of time longer than allowed by TS. The allowed delay in declaring the LCO not met does not change the fact that the condition existed longer than allowed by TS. Tests Required by Section XI of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Code In 10 CFR 50.55a(g) and 50.55a(f), the NRC requires the implementation of inservice inspection and inservice testing programs in accordance with the applicable edition of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code for those pumps and valves whose function is required for safety. The STS contain these testing requirements. As with surveillance testing, an operation or condition prohibited by the TS existed and is reportable if the testing indicates that equipment (e.g., one train of a multiple-train system required to be operable by the TS) was not capable of performing its specified safety functions (and thus was inoperable) for a period of time longer than allowed by TS. Accordingly, similar assumptions and standards should be used. For example, if a timely test indicates that equipment is not capable of performing its specified safety function, it should be assumed that the discrepancy occurred at the time of the test unless there is firm evidence to indicate that it existed previously. #### Design and Analysis Defects and Deviations A design or analysis defect or deviation is reportable under this criterion if, as a result, equipment (e.g., one train of a multiple-train system) was not capable of performing its specified safety functions (and thus was inoperable) for a period of time longer than allowed by TS. Because design and analysis conditions are long lasting, the essential question in this case is whether the equipment was capable of performing its specified safety functions. #### Administrative Requirements Section 5 of the STS, or its equivalent, has a number of administrative requirements, such as organizational structure, the required number of personnel on shift, the maximum hours of work permitted during a specific interval of time, and the requirement to have, maintain, and implement certain specified procedures. Violation of a TS that is administrative in nature is not reportable. For example, a change in the plant's organizational structure that has not yet been approved as a TS change would not be reportable. An administrative procedure violation, or failure to implement a procedure, such as failure to lock a high-radiation-area door, is generally not reportable under this criterion. Radiological conditions and events that are reportable are defined in 10 CFR 20.2202, \"Notification of Incidents,\" and 10 CFR 20.2203, \"Reports of Exposures, Radiation Levels, and Concentrations of Radioactive Material Exceeding the Constraints or Limits.\" Redundant reporting is not required. ##### Entry into STS 3.0.3 STS LCO 3.0.3, or its equivalent, establishes requirements for actions when (1) an LCO is not met and the associated actions are not met, (2) an associated action is not provided, or (3) as directed by the associated actions themselves. Entry into LCO 3.0.3 or its equivalent is not necessarily reportable under this criterion. However, it should be considered reportable under this criterion if any of the shutdown times listed in LCO 3.0.3 (e.g., Modes 3, 4, or 5 for the Westinghouse STS) were exceeded, even if the condition was not discovered until after the allowable time had elapsed and the condition was rectified immediately upon discovery. For a given LCO condition, if shutdown required actions and completion times are listed (e.g., be in hot shutdown in X hours and cold shutdown in Y hours), shutdown times associated with LCO 3.0.3 should not be considered (i.e., only consider LCO action table shutdown completion time added to restorative completion time when determining if \"Operations or Conditions Prohibited by Technical Specifications\" existed). If entry into LCO 3.0.3 is explicitly listed as a required action for a given condition, or for cases in which the condition is not listed in the action table, shutdown times associated with LCO 3.0.3 may be added to any associated restorative completion times found in the action table when determining if \"Operations or Conditions Prohibited by Technical Specifications\" existed. The discussion contained in this section only pertains to \"Operations or Conditions Prohibited by Technical Specifications.\" Entry into LCO 3.0.3 may still result in other reportable conditions under 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73. #### Revised Technical Specifications An LER is not required for discovery of an operation or condition that occurred in the past and was prohibited at the time it occurred if, before the time of discovery, the TS were revised such that the operation or condition is no longer prohibited. Such an event would have little or no significance because the operation or condition would have been determined to be acceptable and allowed under the current TS.",
        "Examples": "(1) Limiting Condition for Operation Exceeded In conducting a timely 30-day surveillance test, a licensee found a standby component with a 7-day LCO-allowed outage time and an associated 8-hour shutdown action statement to be inoperable. (This is equivalent to a 7-day restoration completion time and an 8-hour action completion time in the STS.) Subsequent review indicated that the component was assembled improperly during maintenance conducted 30 days previously and the post maintenance test was not adequate to identify the error. Thus, there was firm evidence that the standby component had been inoperable for the entire 30 days. An LER was required because the condition existed longer than allowed by the TS (the 7-day LCO-allowed outage time and the shutdown action statement time of 8 hours). Had the inoperability been identified and corrected within the required time, the event would not be reportable. #### (2) Late Surveillance Tests A licensee, with the plant in Mode 5 following a 10-month refueling outage, determined that certain monthly TS surveillance tests, which were required to be performed regardless of plant mode, had not been performed as required during the outage. The STS SR 3.0.2 extension was also exceeded. The surveillance tests were immediately performed. No LER would be required if the tests showed the equipment was still capable of performing its specified safety functions. On the other hand, if the tests showed the equipment was not capable of performing its specified safety functions (and thus was inoperable) in excess of the allowed time, the event would be reportable. #### (3) Multiple Test Failures An example of multiple test failures involves the sequential testing of safety valves. Sometimes multiple valves are found to lift with setpoints outside of TS limits. As discussed above, discrepancies found in TS surveillance tests should be assumed to occur at the time of the test unless there is firm evidence, based on a review of relevant information (e.g., the equipment history and the cause of failure), to indicate that the discrepancy occurred earlier. However, the existence of similar discrepancies in multiple valves is an indication that the discrepancies may well have arisen over a period of time and that the failure mode should be evaluated to make this determination. If so, the condition existed during plant operation and the event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) (\"Any operation or condition prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications\"). If the discrepancies are large enough that multiple valves are inoperable, the event may also be reportable under the following criterion in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii): \"Any event where a single cause or condition caused at least one independent train or channel to become inoperable in multiple systems or two independent trains or channels to become inoperable in a single system.\" #### (4) Seismic Restraints Assume it is found that an exciter panel for one EDG had lacked appropriate seismic restraints since the plant was constructed because of a design, analysis, or construction inadequacy. Upon evaluation, the EDG is determined to be inoperable because it is not capable of performing its specified safety functions during and after safe-shutdown earthquake. An LER would be required because the EDG was inoperable for a period of time longer than allowed by TS. #### (5) Vulnerability to Loss of Offsite Power Assume that during a design review it is found that a loss of offsite power could cause a loss of instrument air and, as a result, auxiliary feedwater (AFW) flow control valves could fail open. Therefore, for low steam generator pressure such as could occur for certain main steamline breaks, high AFW flow rates could result in tripping the motor-driven AFW pumps on thermal overload. Therefore, the motor-driven AFW pumps are determined to be inoperable. The single turbine-driven AFW pump is not affected. An LER would be required because the motor-driven portion of AFW was inoperable for a period of time longer than allowed by the TS. #### (6) Entry into STS 3.0.3 The following two examples illustrate the \"Entry into STS 3.0.3\" discussions. Both examples use STS 3.5.1, \"Accumulators\" found in Westinghouse STS, Revision 4, (Agencywide Documents Access and Management System (ADAMS) Accession No. ML12100A222), and assumes historic and current operations in Mode 1. (a) One accumulator inoperable due to boron concentration not within limits When evaluating if an Operation or Condition Prohibited by TS occurred, the timeframe to consider is the total time allowed by Condition A (restorative Completion Time) added to Condition C (shutdown Completion Time). Condition A, \"One accumulator inoperable due to boron concentration not within limits,\" has a Completion Time of 72 hours, while Condition C, \"Required Action and associated Completion Time of Condition A or B not met,\" has a Completion Time of 6 hours to be in Mode 3. If it is determined that one accumulator was inoperable due to boron concentration not within limits for greater than 78 hours (72 hour restorative Completion Time added to 6 hour shutdown Completion Time), then an Operation or Condition Prohibited by TS existed. The condition would be reportable even if the condition was not discovered until after the allowable time had elapsed and the condition was rectified immediately upon discovery. Since the Action table contains shutdown required actions and completion times for the given condition, times associated with LCO 3.0.3 are not considered. ##### (b) Two or more accumulators inoperable When evaluating if an Operation or Condition Prohibited by TS occurred, the timeframe to consider is the total time allowed by Condition D (restorative Completion Time) added to the shutdown time associated with LCO 3.0.3. Condition D, \"Two or more Accumulators inoperable,\" has a Completion Time of Immediately and LCO 3.0.3 requires that the unit be in Mode 3 within 7 hours. If it is determined that two or more accumulators were inoperable for greater than 7 hours (Immediate restorative Completion Time added to 7 hour shutdown time), then an Operation or Condition Prohibited by TS existed. The condition would be reportable even if the condition was not discovered until after the allowable time had elapsed and the condition was rectified immediately upon discovery. #### (7) Laboratory Testing of Charcoal Adsorbers The following example illustrates a scenario in which the results of testing required by the TS are available at a later time. The example uses STS 3.7.10, \"Control Room Emergency Filtration System (CREFS)\" found in Westinghouse STS, Revision 4, (ADAMS Accession No. ML12100A222). While operating in Mode 1, SR 3.7.10.2 is performed on two CREFS filter trains. SR 3.7.10.2 requires CREFS filter testing in accordance with the Ventilation Filter Testing Program (VFTP) found in TS 5.5.11. Part c of the VFTP requires laboratory testing of charcoal adsorber samples. On Day 1, the licensee takes samples and sends it out to a laboratory for analysis. The plant continues to operate in Mode 1. On Day 20, the licensee gets back the results that indicate that the methyl iodide penetration is greater than the value specified in TS 5.5.11.c for one of the filter trains. The licensee then declares the effected CREFS train inoperable. As stated in the Discussion Section above, an Operation or Condition Prohibited by TS can exist even if the condition was not discovered until after the allowable time had elapsed and the condition was rectified immediately upon discovery. When evaluating if an Operation or Condition Prohibited by TS occurred, the timeframe to consider is the total time allowed by Condition A (restorative Completion Time) added to Condition C (shutdown Completion Time). Condition A, \"One CREFS train inoperable for reasons other than Condition B {inoperable boundary},\" has a Completion Time of 7 days and Condition C, \"Required Action and associated Completion Time of Condition A or B not met ... \" has a Completion Time of 6 hours to be in Mode 3. Since the inoperable condition on the effected CREFS train existed for at least 20 days, an Operation or Condition Prohibited by TS existed (i.e., the inoperable condition exceeded the combined 7 day restorative Completion Time added to the 6 hour shutdown Completion Time), The discussions found in this example would still be relevant even if plant specific TS provide additional restrictions on when the test sample must be received back from the laboratory (i.e. verify results within 31 days after sample removal, etc)."

        "Discussion": "(A) Nuclear Power Plant, Including Its Principal Safety Barriers, Being Seriously Degraded This criterion applies to material (e.g., metallurgical or chemical) problems that cause abnormal degradation of or stress upon the principal safety barriers (i.e., the fuel cladding, reactor coolant system (RCS) pressure boundary, or the containment). Abnormal degradation of a barrier may be indicated by the necessity of taking corrective action to restore the barrier's capability, as is the case in some of the examples discussed below. Abnormal stress upon a barrier may result from an unplanned transient, as is the case in one of the examples discussed below. The following are examples of reportable events and conditions: (1) Fuel cladding failures in the reactor, or in the storage pool, that exceed expected values, or that are unique or widespread, or that are caused by unexpected factors. (2) Welding or material defects in the primary coolant system that cannot be found acceptable under ASME Section XI, IWB-3600, \"Analytical Evaluation of Flaws,\" or ASME Section XI, Table IWB-3410-1, \"Acceptance Standards.\" (3) Serious steam generator tube degradation. A licensee's plant-specific TS contain performance criteria for steam generator tube integrity, which includes structural integrity, accident induced leakage, and operational leakage. Steam generator tube degradation is considered serious only if either the steam generator structural integrity or accident-induced leakage performance criteria are not met. In addition, one or more steam generator tubes satisfying the tube repair criteria and not plugged or repaired in accordance with the steam generator program is not considered to be serious steam generator tube degradation and therefore is not reportable as a \"Degraded or Unanalyzed Condition,\" as long as the structural integrity and accident-induced leakage performance criteria are both met. (4) Low temperature over pressure transients in which the pressure-temperature relationship violates pressure-temperature limits derived from Appendix G, \"Fracture Toughness Requirements,\" to 10 CFR Part 50 (e.g., TS pressure-temperature curves). (5) Loss of containment function or integrity, including containment leak rate tests in which the total containment as-found, minimum-pathway leak rate exceeds limits in the facility's TS.4 #### (B) Unanalyzed Condition that Significantly Affects Plant Safety The 1983 Statements of Consideration for 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73 indicated the following with regard to an unanalyzed condition that significantly compromises plant safety: The Commission recognizes that the licensee may use engineering judgment and experience to determine whether an unanalyzed condition existed. It is not intended that this paragraph apply to minor variations in individual parameters, or to problems concerning single pieces of equipment. For example, at any time, one or more safety-related components may be out of service due to testing, maintenance, or a fault that has not yet been repaired. Any trivial single failure or minor error in performing surveillance tests could produce a situation in which two or more often unrelated, safety-grade components are out-of-service. Technically, this is an unanalyzed condition. However, these events should be reported only if they involve functionally related components or if they significantly compromise plant safety.5 When licensees are applying engineering judgment, and there is a doubt regarding whether or not to report, the Commission's policy is that licensees should make the report.6 For example, small voids in systems designed to remove heat from the reactor core that have been previously shown through analysis not to be safety significant need not be reported. However, the accumulation of voids that could inhibit the ability to adequately remove heat from the reactor core, particularly under natural circulation conditions, would constitute an unanalyzed condition and would be reportable.7 4 The LCO typically employs La, which is defined in Appendix J, \"Primary Reactor Containment Leakage Testing for Water-Cooled Power Reactors,\" to 10 CFR Part 50 as the maximum allowable containment leak rate at pressure Pa, the calculated peak containment internal pressure related to the design-basis accident. \"Minimum- pathway leak rate\" means the minimum leak rate that can be attributed to a penetration leakage path; for example, the smaller of either the inboard or outboard valve's individual leak rates. 5 48 FR 39042, August 29, 1983, and 48 FR 33856, July 26, 1983. 6 48 FR 39042, August 29, 1983. 7 48 FR 39042, August 29, 1983, and 48 FR 33856, July 26, 1983. In addition, voiding in instrument lines that results in an erroneous indication causing the operator to misunderstand the true condition of the plant is also an unanalyzed condition and should be reported.8 The level of significance of these cases generally corresponds to the inability to perform a required safety function. For instance, accumulation of voids that could inhibit the ability to adequately remove heat from the reactor core, particularly under natural circulation conditions, has an effect similar to a condition that could prevent the fulfillment of the safety function of the AFW system. Beyond the examples given in 1983, an example of an event reportable as an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety would be the discovery that a system required to meet the single failure criterion does not do so. In another example, if fire barriers are found to be missing, such that the required degree of separation for redundant safe shutdown trains is lacking, the event would be reportable as an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety. On the other hand, if a fire wrap, to which the licensee has committed, is missing from a safe shutdown train but another safe shutdown train is available in a different fire area, protected such that the required separation for safe shutdown trains is still provided, the event would not be reportable.",
        "Examples": "(1) Failures of Reactor Fuel Rod Cladding Identified during Testing of Fuel Assemblies Radiochemistry data for a particular PWR indicated that a number of fuel rods had failed during the first few months of operation. Projections ranged from 6 to 12 failed rods. The end-of-cycle RCS iodine-131 activity averaged 0.025 microcuries per milliliter. Following the end-of-cycle shutdown, iodine-131 spiked to 11.45 microcuries per milliliter. The cause was a significant number of failed fuel rods. Inspections revealed that 136 of the total 157 fuel assemblies contained failed fuel (approximately 300 fuel rods had through-wall penetrations), far exceeding the anticipated number of failures. The defects were generally pinhole sized. The fuel cladding failures were caused by long-term fretting from debris that became lodged between the lower fuel assembly nozzle and the first spacer grid, resulting in penetration of the stainless-steel fuel cladding. The source of the debris was apparently a machining byproduct from the thermal shield support system repairs during the previous refueling outage. The event is reportable because the cladding failures exceed expected values and are unique or widespread. #### (2) Reactor Coolant System Pressure Boundary Degradation Due to Corrosion of a Control Rod Drive Mechanism Flange While the plant was in hot shutdown, a total of six control rod drive mechanism (CRDM) reactor vessel nozzle flanges were identified as leaking. Subsequently, one of the flanges was found to be eroded and pitted. While removing the nut ring from beneath the flange, it was discovered that approximately 50 percent of one of the nut ring halves 8 48 FR 39042, August 29, 1983, and 48 FR 33856, July 26, 1983. had corroded away and that two of the four bolt holes in the corroded nut ring half were degraded to the point that there was no bolt-thread engagement. An inspection of the flanges and spiral wound gaskets, which were removed from between the flanges, revealed that the cause of the leaks was the gradual deterioration of the gaskets from age. A replacement CRDM was installed and the gaskets on all six CRDMs were replaced with new-design graphite-type gaskets. The event is reportable because there is a material defect in the primary coolant system that cannot be found acceptable under ASME Section XI. #### (3) Degradation of Reactor Fuel Rod Cladding Identified during Fuel Sipping Operations With the plant in cold shutdown, fuel sipping operations appeared to indicate that a significant portion of cycle 2 fuel, type \"LYP,\" had failed; i.e., 4 confirmed and 12 potential fuel leakers. The potential fuel leakers had only been sipped once before the ENS notification was made. The licensee contacted the fuel vendor for assistance onsite in evaluating this problem. An ENS notification was made because the fuel cladding degradation was thought to be widespread. However, additional sipping operations and a subsequent evaluation by the licensee's reactor engineering department with vendor assistance concluded that no additional fuel failures had occurred; i.e., the abnormal readings associated with the potential fuel leakers was attributed to fission products trapped in the crud layer. Based on the results of the evaluation, the licensee concluded that the fuel cladding was not seriously degraded and that the event was not reportable. Consequently, after discussion with the regional office, the licensee appropriately retracted this event."

        "Description": "An LER is required for any natural phenomenon or other external condition that poses an actual threat to the safety of the nuclear power plant or significantly hampers site personnel in the performance of duties necessary for the safe operation of the plant.",
        "Discussion": "This criterion applies only to acts of nature (e.g., tornadoes, earthquakes, fires, lightning, hurricanes, floods) and external hazards (e.g., industrial or transportation accidents). References to acts of sabotage are covered by 10 CFR 73.71, \"Reporting of Safeguards Events.\" Actual threats or significant hampering from internal hazards are covered by a separate criterion in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ix), as discussed in Section 3.2.10 of this report. The phrase \"actual threat to safety of the nuclear power plant\" is one reporting trigger. This covers those events involving an actual threat to the plant from an external condition or natural phenomenon in which the threat or damage challenges the ability of the plant to continue to operate in a safe manner (including the orderly shutdown and maintenance of shutdown conditions). The licensee should decide if a phenomenon or condition actually threatens the plant. For example, a minor brush fire in a remote area of the site that is quickly controlled by firefighting personnel and, as a result, did not present a threat to the plant should not be reported. However, a major forest fire, large-scale flood, or major earthquake that presents a clear threat to the plant should be reported. As another example, an industrial or transportation accident that occurs near the site, creating a plant safety concern, should be reported. The licensee must use engineering judgment to determine if there was an actual threat. For example, with regard to tornadoes, the decision would be based on such factors as the size of the tornado and its location and path. There are no prescribed limits. In general, situations involving only monitoring by the plant's staff are not reportable, but if preventive actions are taken or if there are serious concerns, then the situation should be carefully reviewed for reportability. Responsive actions, by themselves, do not necessarily indicate actual threats. Those that are purely precautionary, such as placement of sandbags, even though flood levels are not expected to be high enough to require sandbags, do not trigger reporting. Section 3.2.10 of this report discusses the meaning of the phrase \"significantly hampers site personnel in the performance of duties necessary for the safe operation of the plant,\" in the context of internal threats. A natural phenomenon or external condition may also significantly hamper personnel. If so, it is reportable under this criterion. If a snowstorm, hurricane, or similar event significantly hampers personnel in the conduct of activities necessary for the safe operation of the plant, the event is reportable. In the case of snow, the licensee must use judgment based on the amount of snow, the extent to which personnel were hampered, the extent to which additional assistance could have been available in an emergency, the length of time the condition existed, and so forth. For example, if snow prevented shift relief for several hours, the situation would be reportable if the delay were such that site personnel were significantly hampered in the performance of duties necessary for safe operation. For example, shift personnel might exceed normal shift overtime limits, become excessively fatigued, or find it necessary to operate with fewer than the required number of watchstanders in order to allow some to rest.",
        "Examples": "(1) Earthquake Seismic alarms were received in the Unit 1 control room of a Southern California plant. Seismic monitors were not tripped in Units 2 or 3. The earthquake was readily felt on site. Seismic instrumentation measured less than 0.02 g lateral acceleration. The licensee classified this as an unusual event in accordance with the emergency plan and notified the NRC via ENS per 10 CFR 50.72(a)(1)(i) within 30 minutes of the earthquake. The licensee terminated the event after walkdowns of the plant were satisfactorily completed and made an ENS update call. No LER was submitted because the event was not considered to be an actual threat. #### (2) Hurricane A licensee in southern Florida declared an unusual event after a hurricane warning was issued by the National Hurricane Center. The hurricane was predicted to reach the site in approximately 24 hours. As part of the licensee's severe weather preparations, both operating units were taken to hot shutdown before the hurricane's predicted arrival. Offsite power to both units was lost. As the hurricane approached, wind velocity on site was measured in excess of 140 miles per hour. All personnel were withdrawn to protected safety-related structures. Extensive damage occurred on site. The unusual event was upgraded to an alert when the pressurized fire header was lost because of storm-related damage to the fire protection system water supply piping and electric pump. All safety-related equipment functioned as designed before, during, and after the storm, with the exception of two minor EDG anomalies. The licensee downgraded the alert to an unusual event once offsite power was restored and a damage assessment completed. An ENS notification was required because the licensee declared an emergency class. An LER was required, based on the occurrence of a natural phenomenon that posed an actual threat and several other reporting criteria as well. #### (3) Fire With the unit at 100-percent power, the control room was notified that a forest fire was burning west of the plant close to the 230-kilovolt (kV) distribution lines. Approximately 15 minutes later, voltage fluctuations were observed and then a full reactor scram occurred. The licensee determined that the offsite distribution breakers had tripped on fault, apparently from heavy smoke and heat in the vicinity of the offsite 230-kV line insulators. The other source of offsite power (i.e., the 34.5-kV lines supplying the startup transformers) was also lost. Both station EDGs received a fast start signal and load sequenced as designed. Five minutes later, offsite power was available through the startup transformer to the nonsafety-related 4, 160-volt buses, but the licensee decided to maintain the vital buses on their emergency power source until the reliability of offsite power could be assured. The fire continued to burn and, although no plant structures or equipment were directly affected, the fire did approach within 70 feet of the fire pump house. An ENS notification was required because the licensee entered the emergency plan, declaring an unusual event based on high drywell temperature and an alert based on the potential of the forest fire to further affect the plant. An LER was required, based on the occurrence of a natural phenomenon that posed an actual threat and several other reporting criteria as well. "

        "Discussion": "An event that results or should have resulted in a discharge of the ECCS into the RCS as a result of a valid signal, or an event involving a critical scram, is reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv) (a 4-hour report) unless the actuation resulted from and was part of a preplanned sequence. A valid actuation of any of the systems named in 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(B) is reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) (an 8-hour report) unless the actuation resulted from and was part of a preplanned sequence during testing or reactor operation. A system actuation should be apparent at the time of occurrence. Therefore, if all events are reported properly, it is expected that all reports under 10 CFR 50.72 are as a result of an on- going condition. An actuation of any of the systems named in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B) is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) (a 60-day report) unless the actuation resulted from and was part of a preplanned sequence during testing or reactor operation or the actuation was invalid and occurred while the system was properly removed from service or occurred after the safety function had been already completed. As indicated in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(1), in the case of an invalid actuation reported under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) other than actuation of the RPS when the reactor is critical, the licensee may, at its option, provide a telephone notification to the NRC Operations Center within 60 days after discovery of the event instead of submitting a written LER. In these cases, the telephone report- (1) Is not considered an LER. (2) Should identify that the report is being made under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). (3) Should provide the following information: (a) the specific train(s) and system(s) that were actuated (b) whether each train actuation was complete or partial (c) whether or not the system started and functioned successfully These paragraphs require events to be reported whenever one of the specified systems actuates either manually or automatically. They are based on the premise that these systems are provided to mitigate the consequences of a significant event and, therefore, (1) they should work properly when called upon, and (2) they should not be challenged frequently or unnecessarily. The Commission is interested in both events in which a system was needed to mitigate the consequences of an event (whether or not the equipment performed properly) and events in which a system actuated unnecessarily. Events involving ECCS discharge to the vessel are generally more serious than actuations without discharge to the vessel. Therefore, this reporting criterion is a 4-hour report. Valid signals that should have resulted in a discharge of the ECCS into the RCS but did not due to some component that had failed or an operator action that was taken are reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv). For example, if a valid ECCS signal was generated by plant conditions and the operator put all ECCS pumps in pull-to-lock position, although no ECCS discharge occurred, the event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv). Actuations that need not be reported are those initiated for reasons other than to mitigate the consequences of an event (e.g., at the discretion of the licensee as part of a preplanned procedure). The intent is to require reporting of the actuation of systems that mitigate the consequences of significant events. Usually, the staff would not consider this to include single-component actuations because single components of complex systems, by themselves, usually do not mitigate the consequences of significant events. However, in some cases a component would be sufficient to mitigate the event (i.e., perform the safety function) and its actuation would, therefore, be reportable. This position is consistent with the statement that the reporting requirement is based on the premise that these systems are provided to mitigate the consequences of a significant event. Single trains do mitigate the consequences of events, and, thus, train level actuations are reportable. In this regard, the staff considers actuation of an EDG to be actuation of a train-not actuation of a single component-because an EDG mitigates the event (performs the safety function). (See Example 3 below.) The staff also considers intentional manual actions, in which one or more system components are actuated in response to actual plant conditions resulting from equipment failure or human error, to be reportable because such actions would usually mitigate the consequences of a significant event. This position is consistent with the statement that the Commission is interested in events in which a system was needed to mitigate the consequences of the event. For example, starting a safety injection (SI) pump in response to a rapidly decreasing pressurizer level or starting high-pressure coolant injection (HPCI) in response to a loss of feedwater would be reportable. However, shifting alignment of makeup pumps or closing a containment isolation valve for normal operational purposes would not be reportable. Actuation of multichannel actuation systems is defined as actuation of enough channels to complete the minimum actuation logic. Therefore, single-channel actuations, whether caused by failures or otherwise, are not reportable if they do not complete the minimum actuation logic. Note, however, that if only a single logic channel actuates when, in fact, the system should have actuated in response to plant parameters, this would be reportable under these paragraphs as well as under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) (\"event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of .... \"). With regard to preplanned actuations, operation of a system as part of a planned test or operational evolution need not be reported. Preplanned actuations are those that are expected to actually occur due to preplanned activities covered by procedures. Such actuations are those for which a procedural step or other appropriate documentation indicates that the specific actuation is actually expected to occur. Control room personnel are aware of the specific signal generation before its occurrence or indication in the control room. However, if, during the test or evolution, the system actuates in a way that is not part of the planned evolution, that actuation should be reported. For example, if the normal reactor shutdown procedure requires that the control rods be inserted by a manual reactor scram, the reactor scram need not be reported. However, if unanticipated conditions develop during the shutdown that cause an automatic reactor scram, such a reactor scram should be reported. The fact that the safety analysis assumes that a system will actuate automatically during an event does not eliminate the need to report that actuation. Actuations that need not be reported are those initiated for reasons other than to mitigate the consequences of an event (e.g., at the discretion of the licensee as part of a planned evolution). Note that, if an operator were to manually scram the reactor in anticipation of receiving an automatic reactor scram, this would be reportable just as the automatic scram would be reportable. Valid actuations are those actuations that result from valid signals or from intentional manual initiation, unless it is part of a preplanned test. Valid signals are those signals that are initiated in response to actual plant conditions or parameters satisfying the requirements for initiation of the system. They do not include those that are the result of other signals. Invalid actuations are, by definition, those that do not meet the criteria for being valid. Thus, invalid actuations include actuations that are not the result of valid signals and are not intentional manual actuations. Except for critical scrams, invalid actuations are not reportable by telephone under 10 CFR 50.72. In addition, invalid actuations are not reportable under 10 CFR 50.73 in any of the following circumstances: (1) The invalid actuation occurred when the system was already properly removed from service. This means that all requirements of plant procedures for removing equipment from service have been met. It includes required clearance documentation, equipment and control board tagging, and properly positioned valves and power supply breakers. (2) The invalid actuation occurred after the safety function had already been completed. An example would be RPS actuation after the control rods have already been inserted into the core. If an invalid actuation reveals a defect in the system so that the system failed or would fail to perform its intended function, the event continues to be reportable under other requirements of 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73. When invalid actuations excluded by the conditions described above occur as part of a reportable event, they should be described as part of the reportable event in order to provide a complete, accurate, and thorough description of the event.",
        "Examples": "(1) Reactor Protection System Actuation . The licensee was placing the RHR system in its shutdown cooling mode while the plant was in hot shutdown. The BWR vessel level decreased for unknown reasons, causing RPS scram and Group III primary containment isolation signals, as designed. All control rods had been previously inserted and all Group III isolation valves had been manually isolated. The licensee isolated RHR to stop the decrease in reactor vessel level. An ENS notification and an LER are both required because, although the systems' safety functions had already been completed, the RPS scram and primary containment isolation signals were valid and the actuations were not part of the planned procedure. The automatic signals were valid because they were generated from the sensor by measurement of an actual physical system parameter that was at its setpoint. · With the BWR defueled, an invalid signal actuated the RPS. There was no component operation because the control rod drive system had been properly removed from service. This event is not reportable because (1) the RPS signal was invalid, and (2) the system had been properly removed from service. · At a BWR, both recirculation pumps tripped as a result of a breaker problem. This placed the plant in a condition in which BWRs are typically scrammed to avoid potential power/flow oscillations. At this plant, for this condition, a written off-normal procedure required the plant operations staff to scram the reactor. The plant staff performed a reactor scram, which was uncomplicated. This event is reportable as a manual RPS actuation. Even though the reactor scram was in response to an existing written procedure, this event does not involve a preplanned sequence because the loss of recirculation pumps and the resultant off-normal procedure entry were event driven, not preplanned. Both an ENS notification and an LER are required. In this case, the licensee initially retracted the ENS notification, believing that the event was not reportable. After staff review and further discussion, it was agreed that the event is reportable for the reasons discussed above. #### (2) Boiling Water Reactor Control Rod Block Monitor Actuation A rod block that was part of the planned startup procedure occurred from the rod block monitor, which, at this plant, is classified as a portion of the RPS. This event is not reportable because it occurred as a part of a preplanned startup procedure that specified that certain rod blocks were expected to occur. #### (3) Emergency Diesel Generator Starts . An EDG automatically started when a technician inadvertently caused a short circuit that de-energized an essential bus during a calibration. The actuation was valid because an essential bus was de-energized. The event is reportable because the EDG autostart was not identified at the step in the calibration procedure being used. · After an automatic EDG start, and for unknown reasons, the emergency bus feeder breaker from the EDG did not close when power was lost on the bus. The event is reportable because the actuation logic for the EDG start was completed, even though the EDG did not power the safety buses. #### (4) Preplanned Manual Scram During a normal reactor shutdown, the reactor shutdown procedure required that reactor power be reduced to a low power, at which point the control rods were to be inserted by a manual reactor scram. The rods were manually scrammed. This event is not reportable because the manual scram resulted from and was, by procedure, part of a preplanned sequence of reactor operation. However, if conditions develop during the process of shutting down that require an unplanned reactor scram, the RPS actuation (whether manually or automatically produced) is reportable. #### (5) Actuation of Wrong Component during Testing During surveillance testing of the MSIVs, an operator incorrectly closed MSIV D when the procedure specified closing MSIV C. This event is not reportable because the event is an inadvertent actuation of a single component rather than a train-level actuation (and the purpose of the actuation was not to mitigate the consequences of an event). #### (6) Reactor Water Cleanup Isolation A Reactor Water Cleanup (RWCU) primary containment isolation occurred on pressurization between the RWCU suction containment isolation valves, as designed to isolate a pipe break. It is a valid signal because this is the safety function of the containment isolation system. Regardless, the event is not reportable because the signal did not affect containment isolation valves in multiple systems. #### (7) Manual Actuation of Component in Response to Actual Plant Condition At a PWR, maintenance personnel inadvertently pulled an instrument line out of a compression fitting connection at a pressure transmitter. The resultant RCS leak was estimated at between 70 and 80 gallons per minute. Charging flow increased due to automatic control system action. The operations staff recognized the symptoms of an RCS leak and entered the appropriate off-normal procedure. The procedure directed the operations staff to start a second charging pump, and flow was manually increased to raise pressurizer level. Based on the response of the pressurizer level, the operations staff determined that a reactor scram and SI were not necessary. Maintenance personnel still at the transmitter closed the instrument block and root valves, terminating the event. The staff considers the manual start of the charging pump (which also serves as an ECCS pump, but with a different valve lineup) in response to dropping pressurizer level to be an intentional manual actuation in response to equipment failure or human error and reportable because it constitutes deliberate manual actuation of a single component, in response to plant conditions, to mitigate the consequences of an event. As discussed previously in this section, actuations that need not be reported are those that are initiated for reasons other than to mitigate the consequences of an event (e.g., at the discretion of the licensee as part of a planned procedure or evolution). #### (8) Actuation during Maintenance Activity At a BWR, a maintenance activity was underway involving placement of a jumper to avoid unintended actuations. The maintenance staff recognized that there was a high potential for a loss of contact with the jumper and consequent actuation. This potential was explicitly stated in the maintenance work request and on a risk evaluation sheet. The operating staff was briefed on the potential actuations prior to start of work. During the event, a loss of continuity did occur and the actuations occurred, involving isolation, standby gas treatment start, closing of some valves in the primary containment isolation system (recirculation pump seal mini purge valve, nitrogen supply to drywell valve, and containment atmospheric monitoring valve). The event is not reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv) or (b)(3)(iv) because the actuations were not valid. It is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv) because the actuations were not listed as (and were not) definitely expected to occur."

        "Description": "If the event or condition could have prevented fulfillment of the safety function at the time of discovery, an ENS notification and an LER are required. If it could have prevented fulfillment of the safety function at any time within 3 years of the date of discovery, but not at the time of discovery, only an LER is required. If the event or condition could have prevented fulfillment of the safety function at the time of discovery, and if it is not reported under 10 CFR 50.72(a), (b)(1), or (b)(2), an ENS notification is required under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3).",
        "Discussion": "This criterion is based on the assumption that safety-related SSCs are intended to mitigate the consequences of an accident. SSCs within scope include only safety-related SSCs required by the TS to be operable that are intended to mitigate the consequences of an accident as discussed in Chapters 6 and 15 of the Final Safety Analysis Report (or equivalent chapters). Accidents are identified as events of moderate frequency, infrequent incidents, or limiting faults as discussed in Regulatory Guide 1.70, \"Standard Format and Content of Safety Analysis Reports for Nuclear Power Plants (LWR Edition)\" (or equivalent classifications of the three types of events). The American Nuclear Society (ANS) categorizes these events as Condition II, III, and IV type events. The level of judgment for reporting an event or condition under this criterion is a reasonable expectation of preventing fulfillment of a safety function. In the discussions that follow, many of which are taken from previous NUREG guidance, several different expressions, such as \"would have,\" \"could have,\" \"alone could have,\" and \"reasonable doubt,\" are used to characterize this standard. In the staff's view, all of these should be judged on the basis of a reasonable expectation of preventing fulfillment of the safety function. A SSC that has been declared inoperable is one in which the SSC capability is degraded to a point where it cannot perform with reasonable expectation or reliability. These criteria cover an event or condition in which scoped in SSCs could have failed to perform their intended function because of one or more personnel errors, including procedure violations; equipment failures; inadequate maintenance; or design, analysis, fabrication, equipment qualification, construction, or procedural deficiencies and no redundant equipment in the same system was operable. As a result, for SSCs within the scope of this criterion, a report is required when 1) there is a determination that the SSC is inoperable in a required mode or other specified condition in the TS Applicability, 2) the inoperability is due to one or more personnel errors, including procedure violations; equipment failures; inadequate maintenance; or design, analysis, fabrication, equipment qualification, construction, or procedural deficiencies, and 3) no redundant equipment in the same system was operable. For guidance on determining whether a SSC is operable, see RIS 2005-20, Revision 1. Operable but nonconforming or degraded conditions are not considered reportable under this criterion. As a result, reports are not required when systems are declared inoperable as part of a planned evolution for maintenance or surveillance testing when done in accordance with an approved procedure and the plant's TS (unless a condition is discovered that would have resulted in the system being declared inoperable). In addition, unless a condition is discovered that would have resulted in the system being declared inoperable, reports are not required when systems are declared inoperable solely as a result of Required Actions for which the bases is the assumption of an additional random single failure (i.e. Westinghouse STS, Revision 4, LCO 3.8.1, \"AC Sources - Operating,\" Required Actions A.2, B.2, or C.1 (ADAMS Accession No.ML12100A222)). The event must be reported regardless of whether or not an alternate safety system could have been used to perform the safety function. For example, if the onsite power system was declared inoperable due to equipment failures, the event would be reportable, even if the offsite power system remained operable. For systems that include three or more trains, the inoperability of two or more trains should be reported if, in the judgment of the licensee, the remaining operable trains could not mitigate the consequences of an accident. There are a limited number of single-train systems that perform safety functions (e.g., the HPCI system in BWRs). For such systems, inoperability of the single train is reportable even though the plant TS may allow such a condition to exist for a limited time. If the retraction or cancellation of a report under this criterion is due to a revised operability determination, the retraction or cancellation should discuss the basis for why the operability determination was revised, and why it is believed that system operability was never lost (i.e., in lieu of the initial determination).",
        "Examples": "SINGLE-TRAIN SYSTEMS ##### (1) Failure of a Single-Train System Preventing Accident Mitigation and Residual Heat Removal When the licensee was preparing to run a surveillance test, an HPCI flow controller was found to be inoperable; therefore, the licensee declared the HPCI system inoperable. The plant entered a TS requiring that the automatic depressurization, low-pressure coolant injection, core spray, and isolation condenser systems remain operable during the 7-day LCO or the plant would have to be shut down. The licensee made an ENS notification within 28 minutes and a followup call after the amplifier on the HPCI flow transmitter was fixed and the HPCI returned to operability. As discussed above, the loss of a single-train safety system such as BWR HPCI is reportable. ##### (2) Failure of a Single-Train Nonsafety System Question: If reactor core isolation cooling (RCIC) is not a \"safety system\" in that no credit for its operation is taken in the safety analysis, are failures and unavailability of this system reportable? Answer: If the plant's safety analysis considered RCIC as a system needed to mitigate a rod ejection accident and it is included in the TS, then its failure is reportable under this criterion; otherwise, it is not reportable under this section of the rule. ##### (3) Failure of a Single-Train Environmental System Question: There are a number of environmental systems in a plant dealing with such things as low-level waste (e.g., gaseous radwaste tanks). Many of these systems are not required to meet the single failure criterion, so a single failure results in the loss of function of the system. Are all of these systems covered within the scope of the LER rule? Answer: Such systems would be within scope if they are safety-related systems retained in the TS that are intended to mitigate the consequences of an accident. #### LOSS OF TWO TRAINS (4) Loss of Onsite Emergency Power by Multiple Equipment Inoperability and Unavailability During refueling, one EDG in a two-train system was out of service for maintenance. The second EDG was declared inoperable when it failed its surveillance test. An ENS notification is required and an LER is required. As addressed in the discussion section above, loss of the onsite power system is reportable under this criterion. ##### (5) Procedure Error Prevents Reactor Shutdown Function The unit was in Mode 5 (cold and depressurized, before initial criticality) and a postmodification test was in progress on the train A RPS, when the operator observed that both train A and B source range detectors were disabled. During postmodification testing on the train A RPS, instrumentation personnel placed the train B input error inhibit switch in the inhibit position. With both trains' input error inhibit switches in the inhibit position, source range detector voltage was disabled. The input error inhibit switch was immediately returned to the normal position, and a caution was added to appropriate plant instructions. This event is reportable because disabling the source range detectors could have prevented fulfillment of the safety function to shut down the reactor. ##### (6) Failure of the Overpressurization Mitigation System The RCS was overpressurized on two occasions during startup following a refueling outage because the overpressure mitigation system (OMS) failed to operate. The reason that the OMS failed to operate was that one train was out of service for maintenance, a pressure transmitter was isolated, and a summator failed in the actuation circuit on the other train. The event is reportable because the OMS failed to perform its safety function. ##### (7) Loss of Saltwater Cooling System and Flooding in Saltwater Pump Bay During maintenance activities on the south saltwater pump, the licensee was removing the pump internals from the casing when flooding of the pump area occurred. The north saltwater pump was secured to prevent pump damage. The event is reportable because of the failure of the saltwater cooling system, which is the ultimate heat sink for the facility, to perform its safety function. ##### (8) Maintenance Affecting Two Trains Question: Some clarification is needed for events or conditions that \"could have\" prevented the fulfillment of a system safety function. Answer: With regard to maintenance problems, events or conditions generally involve operator actions and/or component failures that could have prevented the functioning of a safety system. For example, assume that a surveillance test is run on a standby pump and it seizes. The pump is disassembled and found to contain the wrong lubricant. The redundant pump is disassembled and it also has the same wrong lubricant. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the second pump would have failed if it had been challenged. However, the second pump and, therefore, the system did not actually fail because the second pump was never challenged. Thus, in this case, because of the use of the wrong lubricant, the system \"could have\" or \"would have\" failed. #### LOSS OF ONE TRAIN ##### (9) Contaminated Hydraulic Fluid Degrades Main Steam Isolation Valve Operation Situation: During a routine shutdown, the operator noted that the #11 MSIV closing time appeared to be excessive. A subsequent test revealed the #11 MSIV to shut within the required time; however, the #12 MSIV closing time exceeded the maximum at 7.4 seconds. Contamination of the hydraulic fluid in the valve actuation system had caused the system's check valves to stick and delay the transmission of hydraulic pressure to the actuator. The licensee will purchase three more filters, providing supplemental filtering for each MSIV. Finer filters will be used in pump suction filters to remove the fine contaminants. The #12 MSIV was repaired and returned to service. Because the valves were not required for operation at the time of discovery, the safety of the public was not affected. Comments: The event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) because the condition could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function. The event is not reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v) because, at the time of discovery, the plant was shut down and the MSIVs were not required to be operable. (10) Emergency Diesel Generator Lube Oil Fire Hazard Situation: While the licensee was performing a routine surveillance test of the EDG, a small fire started due to lubricating oil leakage from the exhaust manifold. The manufacturer reviewed the incident and determined that the oil was accumulating in the exhaust manifold due to leakage originating from above the upper pistons of this vertically opposed piston engine. The oil remaining above the upper pistons after shutdown leaked slowly down past the piston rings, into the combustion space, past the lower piston rings, through the exhaust ports, and into the exhaust manifolds. The exhaust manifolds became pressurized during the subsequent startup, which forced the oil out through leaks in the exhaust manifold gaskets where it was ignited. Similar events occurred previously at this plant. In these previous cases, fuel oil accumulated in the exhaust manifold due to extended operation under \"no load\" conditions. Operation under loaded conditions was therefore required before shutdown in order to burn off any accumulated oil. Comments: The event is not reportable if the fire did not pose a threat to the plant (e.g., it did not significantly hamper site personnel per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(x)). The event would be reportable if it demonstrated a design, procedural, or equipment deficiency that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function (i.e., if the redundant diesels are of similar design and, therefore, susceptible to the same problem) (10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vi)). ##### (11) Single Failures Question: Suppose you have one pump in a cooling water system (e.g., chilled water) supplying water to both trains of a safety system, but there is another pump in standby; is the loss of the one operating pump reportable? Answer: No. Single, independent (i.e., random) component failures are not reportable if the redundant component in the same system did or would have fulfilled the safety function. However, if such failures have generic implications, then an LER is to be submitted. ##### (12) Generic Setpoint Drift · Situation: With the plant in steady-state power operation and while performing a main steamline pressure instrument functional test and calibration, the licensee found a switch to actuate at 853 pounds per square inch, gauge. The TS limit is 825+15. The redundant switches were operable. The cause of the occurrence was setpoint drift. The switch was recalibrated and tested successfully per HNP-2-5279, \"Barksdale Pressure Switch Calibration,\" and returned to service. This is a repetitive event as reported in one previous LER. A generic review revealed that this type of switch is used on other safety systems and that this type of switch is subject to drift. An investigation will continue as to why these switches drift, and, if necessary, they will be replaced. Comments: The event is not reportable due to the drift of a single pressure switch. The event is reportable if it is indicative of a generic and/or repetitive problem with this type of switch, which is used in several safety systems (10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vi) or (vii)). · Question: Are setpoint drift problems with a particular switch to be reported if they are experienced more than once? Answer: The independent failure (e.g., excessive setpoint drift) of a single pressure switch is not reportable unless it could have caused a system to fail to fulfill its safety function or is indicative of a generic problem that could have resulted in the failure of more than one switch and thereby cause one or more systems to fail to fulfill their safety functions. ##### (13) Maintenance Affecting Only One Train Question: Suppose the wrong lubricant was installed in one pump, but the pump in the other train was correctly lubricated. Is this reportable? Answer: Engineering judgment is required to decide if the lubricant could have been used on the other pump, and, therefore, the system function would have been lost. If the procedure called for testing of the first pump before maintenance was performed on the second pump, and testing clearly identified the error, then the error would not be reportable. However, if the procedure called for the wrong lubricant and eventually both pumps would have been improperly lubricated, and the problem was only discovered when the first pump was actually challenged and failed, then the error would be reportable. ### OTHER CONDITIONS #### (14) Conditions Observed While System Out of Service Question: Suppose that, during shutdown, we are doing maintenance on both SI pumps, which are not required to be operational. Is this reportable? While shut down, suppose I identify or observe something that would cause the SI pumps not to be operational at power. Is this reportable? Answer: Removing both SI pumps from service to do maintenance is not reportable if the resulting system configuration is not prohibited by the plant's TS. However, if a situation is discovered during maintenance that could have caused both pumps to fail (e.g., they are both improperly lubricated), then that condition is reportable in an LER even though the pumps were not required to be operational at the time that the condition was discovered. As another example, suppose the scram breakers were tested during shutdown conditions, and it was found that opening times for more than one breaker were in excess of those specified, or that undervoltage trip attachments were inoperative. Such potential generic problems are reportable in an LER. #### (15) Emergency Diesel Generator Bearing Problems During the annual inspection of one standby EDG, the lower crankshaft thrust bearing and adjacent main bearing were found to be wiped on the journal surface. The thrust bearing was also found to have a small crack from the main oil supply line across the journal surface to the thrust surface. Inspection of the second, redundant standby EDG revealed similar problems. It was judged that extended operation without corrective action could have resulted in bearing failure. The event is reportable because there was reasonable doubt that the diesels would have completed an extended run under load, as required, if called upon. #### (16) Multiple Control Rod Failures There have been cases in which licensees have erroneously concluded that sequentially discovered failures of systems or components occurring during planned testing are not reportable. The NRC identified this situation as a generic concern on April 3, 1985, in Information Notice (IN) 85-27, \"Notifications to the NRC Operations Center and Reporting Events in Licensee Event Reports,\" regarding the reportability of multiple events in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) (event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function). IN 85-27 described multiple failures of an RPS during control rod insertion testing of a reactor at power. One of the control rods stuck. Subsequent testing identified 3 additional rods that would not insert (scram) into the core and 11 control rods that had an initial hesitation before insertion. The licensee considered each failure as a single random failure; thus, each was determined not to be reportable. Subsequent assessments indicated that the instrument air system, which was to be oil free, was contaminated with oil that was causing the scram solenoid valves to fail. Although the failure of a single rod to insert may not cause a reasonable doubt about the ability of other rods to insert, the failure of more than one rod does cause a reasonable doubt. As indicated in IN 85-27, multiple failures of redundant components of a safety system are sufficient reason to expect that the failure mechanism, even though not known, could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function. #### (17) Potential Loss of High-Pressure Coolant Injection During normal refueling leak testing of the upstream containment isolation check valve on the HPCI steam exhaust, the disc of the noncontainment isolation check valve was found to be lodged in downstream piping. This might have prevented HPCI from functioning if the disc had blocked the line. The event was caused by fatigue failure of a disc pin. Following evaluation of the condition, the event was determined to be reportable because the HPCI could have been prevented from performing its safety function if the disc had blocked the line. In addition, the event is reportable if the fatigue failure is indicative of a common mode failure. #### (18) Operator Inaction or Wrong Action Question: In some systems used to control the release of radioactivity, a detector controls certain equipment. In other systems, a monitor is present and the operator is required to initiate action under certain conditions. The operator is not \"wired\" in. Are failures of the operator to act reportable? Answer: Yes. The operator may be viewed as a \"component\" that is an integral, and frequently essential, part of a \"system.\" Thus, if an event or condition meets the reporting criterion, it is to be reported regardless of the initiating cause. #### (19) Results of Analysis Question: A number of criteria indicate that they apply to actual situations only and not to potential situations identified as a result of analysis; yet, other criteria address \"could have.\" When do the results of analysis have to be reported? Answer: The results need only be reported if the applicable criterion requires the reporting of conditions that \"could have\" caused a problem. However, others have a need to know about potential problems that are not reportable; thus, such items may be reported as a voluntary LER. #### (20) System Interactions Question: Utilities are not required to analyze for system interactions, yet the rule requires the reporting of events that \"could have\" happened but did not. Are we to initiate a design activity to determine \"could have\" system interactions? Answer: No. Report system interactions that you find as a result of ongoing, routine activities (e.g., the analysis of operating events). "

        "Description": "An LER is required for a common cause inoperability of independent trains or channels.",
        "Discussion": "This criterion requires those events to be reported in which a single cause or condition caused independent trains or channels to become inoperable. Common causes may include such factors as high ambient temperatures, heatup from energization, inadequate preventive maintenance, oil contamination of air systems, incorrect lubrication, use of nonqualified components, or manufacturing or design flaws. The event is reportable if the independent trains or channels were inoperable at the same time, regardless of whether or not they were discovered at the same time. (Example 2 below illustrates a case in which the second failure was discovered 3 days later than the first.) An event or failure that results in or involves the failure of independent portions of more than one train or channel in the same or different systems is reportable. For example, if a cause or condition caused components in train A and B of a single system to become inoperable, even if additional trains (e.g., train C) were still available, the event must be reported. In addition, if the cause or condition caused components in train A of one system and in train B of another system (i.e., the train that is assumed in the safety analysis to be independent) to become inoperable, the event must be reported. However, if a cause or condition caused components in train A of one system and train A of another system (i.e., trains that are not assumed in the safety analysis to be independent), the event need not be reported unless it meets one or more of the other reporting criteria. Trains or channels, for reportability purposes, are defined as those redundant, independent trains or channels designed to provide protection against single failures. Many engineered safety systems containing active components are designed with at least a two-train system. Each independent train in a two-train system can normally satisfy all of the safety system requirements to safely shut down the plant or satisfy those criteria that have to be met following an accident. This criterion does not include those cases in which one train of a system or a component was removed from service as part of a planned evolution, in accordance with an approved procedure, and in accordance with the plant's TS. For example, if the licensee removes part of a system from service to perform maintenance, and the TS permit the resulting configuration, and the system or component is returned to service within the time limit specified in the TS, the action need not be reported under this paragraph. However, if, while the train or component is out of service, the licensee identifies a condition that could have prevented the whole system from performing its intended function (e.g., the licensee finds a set of relays that is wired incorrectly), that condition must be reported. Analysis of events reported under this part of the rule may identify previously unrecognized common cause (or dependent) failures and system interactions. Such failures can be simultaneous failures that occur because of a single initiating cause (i.e., the single cause or mechanism serves as a common input to the failures), or the failures can be sequential (i.e., cascading failures), such as the case in which a single component failure results in the failure of one or more additional components.",
        "Examples": "(1) Incorrect Lubrication Degrades Main Steam Isolation Valve Operation During monthly operability tests, the licensee found that the Unit 2B inboard MSIV did not stroke properly as a result of a solenoid-operated valve failure. Both units were shut down from 100-percent power, and the solenoid-operated valves piloting all 16 MSIVs were inspected. The licensee found that the solenoid-operated valves on all 16 MSIVs were damaged. The three-way and four-way valves and solenoid pilot valves on all 16 MSIVs had a hardened, sticky substance in their ports and on their O-rings. As a result, motion of all the solenoid-operated valves was impaired, resulting in instrument air leakage and the inability to operate all of the MSIVs satisfactorily. The licensee also examined unused spares in the warehouse and found that the lubricant had dried out in those valves, leaving a residue. Several of the warehouse spares were bench tested. They were found to be degraded and also leaked. The root cause of the event was use of an incorrect lubricant. The event is reportable (1) because a single cause or condition caused multiple independent trains of the main steam isolation system (a system designed to control the release of radioactive material and mitigate the consequences of an accident) to become inoperable (10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)(C) and (D)), and (2) because a single condition could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function (10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)). #### (2) Marine Growth Causing Emergency Service Water To Become Inoperable (Common Mode Failure Mechanism) With Unit 1 at 74-percent power and Unit 2 at 100-percent power, emergency service water (ESW) pump 1A was declared inoperable because its flow rate was too low to meet acceptance criteria. Three days later, with both units at the same conditions, ESW pump 1C was declared inoperable for the same reason. The ESW pumps are the source of water from the intake canal during a design-basis accident. In both cases, the cause was marine growth of hydroids and barnacles on the impeller and suction of the pumps. Following maintenance, both pumps passed their performance tests and were placed in service. Pump testing frequency was increased to more closely monitor pump performance. This event is reportable because a single cause or condition caused two independent trains to become inoperable in a single system designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident (10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)(D)). #### (3) Testing Indicated Several Inoperable Snubbers The licensee found 11 inoperable snubbers during periodic testing. All of the snubbers failed to lock up in tension and/or compression. These failures did not render their respective systems inoperable but did render trains inoperable. Improper lockup settings and/or excessive seal bypass caused these snubbers to malfunction. These snubbers were designed for low-probability seismic events. Numerous previous similar events have been reported by this licensee. This condition is reportable because the condition indicated a generic common mode problem that caused numerous multiple independent trains in one or more safety systems to become inoperable. The potential existed for numerous snubbers in several systems to fail following a seismic event, rendering several trains inoperable (10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)). #### (4) Stuck High-Pressure Injection System Check Valves as a Result of Corroded Flappers The licensee reported that check valves in three of four high-pressure injection (HPI) lines were stuck closed. The unit had been shut down for refueling and maintenance. A special test of the check valves revealed that three stop check valves failed to open when a differential pressure up to the capacity of the pump was applied. Further review showed that the common cause of valve failure was the flappers corroding shut. The event is reportable because a single cause or condition caused at least two independent trains of the HPI system to become inoperable. This system is designed to remove residual heat and mitigate the consequences of an accident. The condition is therefore reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii)(B) and (D) (common cause failure in systems designed to remove residual heat and mitigate accidents)."

        "Description": "An LER is required for a release as defined in the rules.",
        "Discussion": "Although similar to 10 CFR 20.2202 and 20.2203, these criteria place a lower threshold for reporting events at commercial power reactors because the significance of the breakdown of the licensee's program that allowed such a release is the primary concern, rather than the significance of the effect of the actual release. In contrast, however, the time limit for reporting under 10 CFR 20.2202 and 20.2203 is more restrictive. For a release that took less than 1 hour, normalize the release to 1 hour (e.g., if the release lasted 15 minutes, divide by 4). For releases that lasted more than 1 hour, use the highest release for any continuous 60-minute period (i.e., comparable to a moving average). Annual average meteorological data should be used for determining offsite airborne concentrations of radioactivity to maintain consistency with the TS for reportability thresholds. The location used as the point of release for calculation purposes should be determined using the expanded definition of an unrestricted area as specified in NUREG-0133, \"Preparation of Radiological Effluent Technical Specifications for Nuclear Power Plants,\" issued October 1978, to maintain consistency with the TS.",
        "Examples": "(1) Unmonitored Release of Contaminated Steam through Auxiliary Boiler Atmospheric Vent An unmonitored release of contaminated steam resulted from a combination of a tube leak, improper venting of an auxiliary boiler system, and inadequate procedures. This combination resulted in a release path from a liquid waste concentrator to the atmosphere via the auxiliary boiler system steam drum vent. Because of rain at the site, the steam release to the atmosphere was condensed and deposited onto plant buildings and yard areas. This contamination was washed via a storm drain into a lake. The release was later confirmed to be 2.6x10-5 microcuries per milliliter (uCi/ml) of caesium-137 at the point of entry into the receiving water. An LER for a liquid radioactive material release is required because the unmonitored release exceeded 20 times the applicable concentrations specified in Table 2, Column 2 of Appendix B, \"Annual Limits on Intake (ALIs) and Derived Air Concentrations (DACs) of Radionuclides for Occupational Exposure; Effluent Concentrations; Concentrations for Release to Sewerage,\" to 10 CFR Part 20, \"Standards for Protection against Radiation,\" averaged over 1 hour at the site boundary. #### (2) Unplanned Gaseous Release During routine scheduled maintenance on a pressure-actuated valve in the gaseous waste system, an unplanned radioactive release to the environment was detected by a main stack high radiation alarm. The release occurred when an isolation valve, required to be closed on the station tagout sheet, was inadvertently left open. This allowed radioactive gas from the waste gas decay tank to escape through a pressure gage connection that had been opened to vent the system. Operator error was the root cause of this release, with ambiguous valve tag numbers as a contributing factor. The concentration in the unrestricted area, averaged over 1 hour, was estimated by the licensee to be 1x10-5 uCi/ml of krypton-85 and 5x106 uCi/ml of xenon-133. The event was reportable via an LER because the sum of the ratios of the concentration of each airborne radionuclide in the restricted area when averaged over a period of 1 hour, to its respective concentration specified in Table 2, Column 1 of Appendix B to 10 CFR Part 20, exceeds 20."

        "Description": "An LER is required for an event that poses an actual threat or causes significant hampering, as defined in the rules.",
        "Discussion": "These criteria pertain to internal threats. The criterion for external threats, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iii), is described in Section 3.2.5 of this report. This provision requires reporting events, particularly those caused by acts of personnel, that endanger the safety of the plant or interfere with personnel in the performance of duties necessary for safe plant operations. The licensee must exercise some judgment in reporting under this rule. For example, a small fire on site that did not endanger any plant equipment and did not and could not reasonably be expected to endanger the plant is not reportable. The phrase \"significantly hampers site personnel\" applies narrowly; i.e., only to those events that significantly hamper the ability of site personnel to perform safety-related activities affecting plant safety. In addition, the staff considers the following standards appropriate in this regard: . The significant hampering criterion is pertinent to \"the performance of duties necessary for safe operation of the nuclear power plant.\" One way to evaluate this is to ask if one could seal the room in question (or disable the function in question) for a substantial period of time and still operate the plant safely. For example, if a switchgear room is unavailable for a time, but it is normally not necessary to enter the room for safe operation, and no need to enter the room arises while it is unavailable, the event is not reportable under this criterion. · Significant hampering includes hindering or interfering, provided that the interference or delay is sufficient to significantly threaten the safe operation of the plant. . Actions such as room evacuations that are precautionary would not constitute significant hampering if the necessary actions can still be performed in a timely manner. Plant mode may be considered in determining if there is an actual internal threat to a plant. However, licensees should not incorrectly assume that everything that happens while a plant is shut down is unimportant and not reportable. In-plant releases must be reported if they require evacuation of rooms or buildings and, as a result, the ability of the operators to perform duties necessary for safe operation of the plant is significantly hampered. Events such as minor spills, small gaseous waste releases, or the disturbance of contaminated particulate matter (e.g., dust) that require temporary evacuation of an individual room until the airborne concentrations decrease or until respiratory protection devices are used, are not reportable unless the ability of site personnel to perform necessary safety functions is significantly hampered. No LER is required for precautionary evacuations of rooms and buildings that subsequent evaluation determines were not required. Even if an evacuation affects a major part of the facility, the test for reportability is whether an actual threat to plant safety occurred or whether site personnel were significantly hampered in carrying out their safety responsibilities. In most cases, fires result in an ENS notification because there is a declaration of an emergency class, which is reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(a)(1)(i) as discussed in Section 3.1.1 of this report.9 If there is an actual threat or significant hampering, an LER is also required. With 9 As indicated in NUREG-0654, Revision 1, IN 88-64, \"Reporting Fires in Nuclear Process Systems at Nuclear Power Plants,\" dated August 18, 1988, and Regulatory Guide 1.101, Revision 3, \"Emergency Planning and Preparedness for Nuclear Power Reactors,\" issued August 1992 (which endorses NUMARC/NESP-007, Revision 2), a fire that lasts longer than 10 or 15 minutes or that affects plant equipment important for safe operation would result in declaration of an emergency class. regard to control room fires, the staff generally considers a control room fire to constitute an actual threat and significant hampering. 10",
        "Examples": "(1) Fire in Refueling Bridge Question: If we have a fire in the refueling bridge and we are not moving fuel, would the fire be reportable? Answer: No. If the plant is not moving fuel and the fire does not otherwise threaten other safety equipment and does not hamper site personnel, the fire is not reportable. If the plant is moving fuel, the fire is reportable. #### (2) Fire in Reactor Building Question: If we have a fire in the reactor building that forces contractor personnel who are doing a safety-related modification to leave, but the fire did not hamper operations personnel or equipment, would that fire be reportable? Answer: No. The fire would not be reportable if the fire was not severe enough that it posed an actual threat to the plant and the delay in completing the modification did not significantly threaten the safe operation of the plant."

See the example. 10 It is theoretically possible to have a control room fire that is discovered and extinguished quickly and, even in this location, does not significantly hamper the operators and does not threaten plant safety.

The NRC Operations Center does not need to be made aware of every press release made by a licensee. The following clarifications are intended to set a reporting threshold that ensures necessary reporting while minimizing unnecessary reporting. Examples of events likely to be reportable under this criterion include the following: · release of radioactively contaminated tools or equipment to public areas · unusual or abnormal releases of radioactive effluents . onsite fatality Licensees generally do not have to report media and government interactions unless they are related to the radiological health and safety of the public or onsite personnel, or protection of the environment. For example, the NRC does not generally need to be informed under this criterion of the following: · minor deviations from sewage or chlorine effluent limits . minor nonradioactive, onsite chemical spills . minor oil spills · problems with plant stack or water tower aviation lighting · peaceful demonstrations · routine reports of effluent releases to other agencies . releases of water from dams associated with the plant For events or situations related to the health and safety of the public or onsite personnel, or to protection of the environment, licensees are required to notify the NRC within 4 hours of whichever of the following occurs first: . a plan to report to either the press or another government agency is approved by an individual authorized to make the final decision . a report has actually been made to the press or another government agency #### Press Release The NRC has an obligation to inform the public about issues within the NRC's purview that affect or raise a concern about the public health and safety. Thus, the NRC needs accurate, detailed information in a timely manner regarding such situations. The NRC should be aware of information that is available for the press or other government agencies. However, the NRC need not be notified of every press release a licensee issues. The field of NRC interest is narrowed by the phrase \"related to the health and safety of the public or onsite personnel, or protection of the environment\" in order to exclude administrative matters or those events of no significance. Routine radiation releases are not specifically reportable under this criterion. However, if a release receives media attention, the release is reportable under this criterion. If possible, licensees should make an ENS notification before issuing a press release because news media representatives will usually contact the NRC public affairs officer shortly after its issuance for verification, explanation, or interpretation of the facts. #### Other Government Notifications For reporting purposes, \"other government agencies\" refers to local, State, or other Federal agencies. Notifying another Federal agency does not relieve the licensee of the requirement to report to the NRC. Some plants provide a State incident response facility with alarm indication coincident with control room alarms; e.g., an effluent radiation monitor alarm. However, an alarm received at a State facility is in itself not a requirement for notifying the NRC under this criterion. A release is reportable under this criterion if a press release is planned or a specific report (beyond the automatic alarm indication) has been or will be made to a State agency.",
        "Examples": "(1) Onsite Drowning Government Notifications and Press Release A man fell into the discharge canal while fishing and failed to resurface. The licensee notified the local sheriff, State Police, U.S. Coast Guard, and State emergency agencies. Local news agencies were granted onsite access for coverage of the event. The licensee notified the NRC resident inspector. An ENS notification is needed because of the fatality on site, the other government notifications made, and media involvement. #### (2) Licensee Media Inquiries Regarding NRC Findings As a result of a local newspaper article regarding the findings of an NRC regional inspection of the fire protection program under Appendix R, \"Fire Protection Program for Nuclear Power Facilities Operating Prior to January 1, 1979,\" to 10 CFR Part 50, a licensee representative was interviewed on local television and radio stations. The licensee notified State officials and the NRC resident inspector. The staff does not consider an ENS notification to be needed because the subject of the radio and TV interviews was an NRC inspection. #### (3) County Government Notification The licensee informed county governments and other organizations of a spurious actuation of several emergency response sirens in a county (for about 5 minutes, according to county residents). The licensee also planned to issue a press release. An ENS notification is needed because county agencies were notified about the inadvertent actuation of part of the public notification system. Such an event also would be reportable if the county informs the licensee of the problem because of the concern of members of the public for their radiological health and safety. #### (4) State Notification of Unscheduled Radiation Release The licensee reported to the State that it was going to release about 50 curies of gaseous radioactivity to the atmosphere while filling and venting the pressurizer. The licensee then revised its estimate of the release to 153 curies. However, because the licensee had not informed the State within 24 hours of making the release, it had to reclassify the release as \"unscheduled\" per its agreement with the State. The licensee notified the State and the NRC resident inspector. An ENS notification is needed because of the State notification of an \"unscheduled\" release of gaseous radioactivity. The initial notification to the State of the scheduled release does not need an ENS notification because it is considered to be a routine notification. #### (5) State Notification of Improper Dumping of Radioactive Waste The licensee transported two secondary side filters to the city dump as nonradioactive waste but later determined that they were radioactive. The dump site was closed and the filters retrieved. The licensee notified the appropriate State agency and the NRC resident inspector. An ENS notification is needed because of the notification to the State agency of the inadvertent release of radioactively contaminated material off site, which affects the radiological health and safety of the public and environment. #### (6) Reports Regarding Endangered Species The licensee notified the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and a State agency that an endangered species of sea turtle was found in its circulating water structure trash bar. No press release was planned. An ENS notification is required because of the notification of State and Federal agencies regarding the taking of an endangered species. (The NRC has statutory responsibilities regarding protection of endangered species.) #### (7) Routine Agency Notifications A licensee notified the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that the circulation water temperature rise exceeded the release permit allowable. This event was caused by the unexpected loss of a circulating water pump while operating at 92-percent power. The licensee reduced power to 73 percent so that the circulating water temperature would decrease to within the allowable limits until the pump could be repaired. A licensee notified the Federal Aviation Agency that it removed part of its auxiliary boiler stack aviation lighting from service to replace a faulty relay. A licensee notified the State, EPA, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Department of Transportation that 5 gallons of diesel fuel oil had spilled onto gravel-covered ground inside the protected area. The spill was cleaned up by removing the gravel and dirt. The staff does not consider an ENS notification to be needed because these events are routine and have little significance."

        "Description": "If not reported under 10 CFR 50.72(a), (b)(1), or (b)(2), an ENS notification is required under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3) (an 8-hour report) for a major loss of emergency assessment, offsite response, or offsite communications capability. The loss of emergency preparedness capabilities should be apparent at the time of occurrence or discovery. Therefore, if all events are reported properly, it is expected that all reports under 10 CFR 50.72 are as a result of an on- going condition.",
        "Discussion": "This reporting requirement pertains to events that would result in a major loss of emergency assessment capability, offsite response capability, or offsite communications capabilities. The loss of these capabilities could substantially impair a licensee's, or offsite officials', ability to respond to an emergency if one were to occur or has occurred. The focus of this reporting requirement is in the loss of capabilities to perform functions identified in the respective emergency plan. Failures of individual systems or facilities that comprise these capabilities are reportable only to the extent that these failures meet the above threshold. Notifying the NRC of these events permits the NRC to consider implementing compensatory measures and to more completely assess the consequences of such a loss should it occur during an accident or emergency. The following are examples of equipment or facilities that may be encompassed by this reporting requirement: · Emergency Assessment Capabilities \\- safety parameter display system (SPDS) \\- primary emergency response facilities (ERFs) \\- plant monitors necessary for accident assessment · Offsite Response Capabilities \\- public prompt notification system(s) including sirens (primary system) · Offsite Communication Capabilities \\- ENS \\- other emergency communications facilities and equipment used between the licensee's onsite and offsite ERFs, and between the licensee and offsite officials Losses of the above equipment and other situations should be evaluated for reportability as discussed below. #### Loss of Emergency Assessment Capability A major loss of emergency assessment capability includes those events that would significantly impair the licensee's emergency assessment capability if an emergency were to occur. Some engineering judgment is needed to determine the significance of the loss of particular equipment. For example, the loss of the SPDS alone may not need to be reported, but a loss of the SPDS concurrent with other plant indicators or annunciators being unavailable is reportable if the licensee would be unable to assess or monitor an accident or transient in progress. Examples of events that should be evaluated against this threshold for reportability include, but are not limited to: · A loss of a significant portion of control room indication, including annunciators or monitors, or the loss of all plant vent stack radiation monitors, should be evaluated for reportability. In evaluating the reportability of such events, only those display systems, indicators, and annunciators that are relied upon in the emergency plan and the emergency plan implementing procedures addressing classification, assessment, or protective actions; or relied upon in other station procedures that provide input to these activities need to be considered. The indication remaining available should be considered in determining if a major loss of emergency assessment capability has occurred. · A significant degradation in the licensee's ability to perform accident assessment functions assigned to a licensee primary ERF by the emergency plan. Typically, these functions would be the technical support center (TSC) but may include the emergency operations facility (EOF). Degradations would not be reportable if the ERF's assessment capabilities were restored to service within the facility activation times specified in the emergency plan. Planned maintenance which impacts the accident assessment functions of the ERF, or its supporting systems, need not be reported if (1) the ERF's assessment capabilities could be restored to service within the facility acitivation time specified in the emergency plan in the event of an accident or the licensee had implemented viable compensatory actions,11 and (2) the planned outage is not expected to, and subsequently did not, exceed 72 hours. #### Loss of Offsite Response Capability A major loss of offsite response capability includes those events that would significantly impair the ability of the licensee or offsite officials to implement the functions of their respective emergency plans if an emergency were to occur. Examples of events that should be evaluated against this threshold for reportability include, but are not limited to: · The occurrence of a significant natural hazard (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, tornado, flood, major winter storms) or other event that would do one or both of the following: 11 \"Promptly\" means within the licensee's emergency plan requirements for facility activation time. A \"viable\" compensatory action is one that (1) can restore the required function in a reasonably comparable manner and (2) is proceduralized prior to an event. – Prevent State and local jurisdictions from maintaining evacuation routes passable, or from maintaining other parts of the response infrastructure available, to the extent that these jurisdictions would be unable to implement the public protective measures called for in their emergency plan, if known by the licensee, or, \\- Restrict access to the licensee's site, or its offsite primary EOFs, such that the licensee would not be able to augment its on-shift staff or activate its ERFs as required by the emergency plan. Offsite response support relied upon in the emergency plan, such as fire departments, local law enforcement, and ambulance services, would not be able to access the site. Traffic impediments, such as fog, snow, and ice, should generally not be reported if they are within the respective capabilities of the licensee, State, or local officials to resolve or mitigate. Rather, the reporting requirement is intended to apply to more significant cases, such as the conditions around the Turkey Point plant after Hurricane Andrew struck in 1992 or the conditions around the Cooper station during the Midwest floods of 1993. · Failures in the primary public alerting systems (e.g., sirens, tone alert radios), for whatever reason, that result in the loss of the capability to alert a large segment of the population in the emergency planning zone (EPZ) for more than 1 hour. The licensee should take reasonable measures to remain informed of the status of the primary public alerting system, regardless of who maintains the system, and must notify the NRC if the established thresholds are exceeded. A planned outage of the primary public alerting system need not be reported if (1) the licensee had arranged for the implementation of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-approved backup alerting methods should public alerting become necessary, and (2) the planned outage is not expected to, and subsequently did not, exceed 24 hours. ##### Loss of Communications Capability A major loss of communications capability include those events that would significantly impair the ability of the licensee to implement the functions of its emergency plans if an emergency were to occur. Failures of individual communications systems are reportable only to the extent that these failures meet this threshold. The failure of a single communication system need not be reported if there are viable alternative methods12 of communicating information about the emergency. This reporting requirement only addresses those communication systems that enable a licensee to make notifications and provide followup information to Federal, State, and local officials located offsite. It also includes communication capabilities between the site and licensee ERO personnel assigned offsite. Examples of communication systems whose failures should be evaluated against the above threshold for reportability include, but are not limited to, the following: ###### . ERDS 12 A \"viable\" alternative method (or compensatory action) is one that (1) can perform the required function in a reasonably comparable manner and (2) is proceduralized prior to an event. · ENS · health physics network (HPN) · other offsite communication systems, including the following: \\- dedicated telephone communication link to State or local officials \\- dedicated voice and data links between the site and emergency offsite response facilities \\- licensee radio system for communicating with offsite field monitoring teams \\- commercial telephone lines that are relied upon for use in emergency response Each site's communications system will be different, and the significance of the loss of any one communication system may differ from site to site. This reporting requirement is intended to apply to serious conditions during which the telecommunications system can no longer fulfill the communications requirements of the emergency plan. Planned maintenance that impacts the emergency communications capability need not be reported if (1) the communication system could be restored to service promptly in the event of an accident or the licensee had implemented viable compensatory actions, 13 and (2) the planned outage is not expected to, and subsequently did not, exceed 72 hours. Although a notification may not be required under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3(xiii) in the event of a loss of the ENS, HPN, or ERDS because of the availability of viable alternative communication means, the licensee should inform the NRC Operations Center of any failure of these systems so that the NRC may arrange for repair of NRC-supplied communications equipment. When informing the NRC Operations Center, licensees should use the commercial telephone number 301-816-5100. If the Operations Center (or the ERDS Data Center) notifies the licensee that an ENS, HPN, or ERDS line is out of service, there is no need for an additional call. At the time the failure is reported, the licensee should be prepared to supply the following information to expedite repair: (1) name of contact at location of failure, (2) commercial phone number of contact, (3) location of contact (i.e., street address, building number, room number, etc., and (4) any other information that would expedite repair.",
        "Examples": "(1) Loss of Public Prompt Notification System The NRC has not established a numerical threshold (e.g., number, percentage, or area of failed sirens) for this reporting requirement because the thresholds need to be specific to the particular EPZ. The NRC expects its licensees to establish thresholds that reflect the EPZ-specific population density and distribution, the locations of the sirens or other alerting devices, and the overlap in coverage of adjacent sirens. For example, a loss of 10 percent of the sirens in a high-density population area may have greater impact than 13 \"Promptly\" means within the emergency plan requirements specified for the communication system. A loss of the ability to make initial notifications would need to be restored within 15 minutes, while a loss of the ability to communicate between ERFs would need to be restored within the facility activation time. A \"viable\" compensatory action is one that (1) can restore the required function in a reasonably comparable manner, and (2) is proceduralized prior to the event. 50 percent of the sirens lost in a low-density area. Similarly, a loss of 10 percent of the sirens dispersed across the entire EPZ may not be as significant as losing the same number of sirens in a single jurisdiction. As such, notifications of the loss of the primary public prompt notification system will vary according to the licensee's \"major loss\" threshold. Previous notifications have included the following: · 12 of 40 county alert sirens were disabled because of loss of power as a result of severe weather . 28 of 54 alert sirens were reported out of service as a result of a local ice storm · all offsite emergency sirens were: \\- found out of service during a monthly test \\- taken out of service for repair \\- out of service because control panel power was lost \\- out of service because the county radio transmitter failed Failures in the primary public alerting systems (e.g., sirens, tone alert radios), for whatever reason, that result in the loss of the capability to alert a large segment of the population in the EPZ for more than 1 hour should be reported as a major loss of offsite response capability. However, a planned outage need not be reported if (1) the licensee had arranged for the implementation of FEMA-approved backup alerting methods should public alerting become necessary, and (2) the planned outage is not expected to, and subsequently did not, exceed 24 hours. No LER is required because there are no corresponding 10 CFR 50.73 requirements. ##### (2) Loss of ENS and Commercial Telephone System The licensee determined that ENS and commercial telecommunications capability was lost to the control room when a fiber optic cable was severed during maintenance. A communications link was established and maintained between the site and the load dispatcher via microwave transmission. Both the ENS and commercial communications capability were restored approximately 90 minutes later. An ENS notification is required because of the major loss of communications capability. Although the microwave link to the site was established and maintained during the telephone outage, the link would not allow direct communication between the NRC and the control room, and therefore, this in itself does not fully compensate for the loss of communication that would be required in the event of an emergency at the plant. No LER is required because there are no corresponding 10 CFR 50.73 requirements. ##### (3) Loss of Direct Communication Line to Police The licensee determined that the direct telephone line to the State Police had been out of service. In this example, no ENS notification is required because commercial telephone lines to the State Police were available. An ENS notification would be required if the loss of the direct telephone line(s) to various police, local, or State emergency or regulatory agencies is not compensated for by other readily available offsite communications systems. No LER is required because there are no corresponding 10 CFR 50.73 requirements. ##### (4) Loss of the Emergency Response Data System The licensee determined that the ERDS was out of service due to a failure of licensee-owned and -maintained equipment. However, the ENS was available. Because the ERDS is identified as a supplement to the ENS in Appendix E of 10 CFR 50, the failure of the ERDS does not constitute a major loss of offsite communication capability provided that the ENS is available and, as a result, no report under this reporting criterion is required. If, however, the failure is determined to be in NRC-maintained equipment, the licensee should inform the ERDS help desk of the outage so that the NRC can arrange for repair."

        ],
        "Description": "An LER is required for an event that meets the conditions stated in the rule.",
        "Discussion": "The level of judgment for reporting an event or condition under this criterion is a reasonable expectation of preventing fulfillment of a safety function. In the discussions that follow, several different expressions, such as \"would have,\" \"could have,\" \"alone could have,\" and \"reasonable doubt,\" are used to characterize this standard. In the staff's view, all of these should be judged on the basis of a reasonable expectation of preventing fulfillment of the safety function. For trains or channels that have been declared inoperable, the capability is considered degraded to a point where it cannot perform with reasonable expectation or reliability. As a result, subject to the exceptions stated in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ix)(B)(1) and (2), for trains or channels within the scope of this criterion, a report is required when there is a determination that two or more trains or channels in different systems are inoperable as a result of a single cause while in a required mode or other specified condition in the TS Applicability. However, reports are not required when trains or channels in different systems are declared inoperable as part of a planned evolution for maintenance or surveillance testing when done in accordance with an approved procedure and the plant's TS (unless a condition is discovered that would have resulted in the trains or channels in different systems being declared inoperable as a result of a single cause). For guidance on determining whether a train or channel is operable, see RIS 2005-20, Revision 1. Operable but nonconforming or degraded conditions are not considered reportable under this criterion. The intent of this criterion is to capture those events in which, as a result of a single cause, there would have been a failure of two or more trains or channels to properly complete their safety function, regardless of whether there was an actual demand. For example, if, as a result of a single cause, a train of the HPSI system and a train of the AFW system failed, the event would be reportable even if there was no demand for the systems' safety functions. Examples of a single cause responsible for a reportable event may include cases of procedural error, equipment failure, or discovery of a design, analysis, fabrication, construction, or procedural inadequacy. They may also include such factors as high ambient temperatures, heatup from energization, inadequate preventive maintenance, oil contamination of air systems, incorrect lubrication, or use of nonqualified components. The event is reportable if, as a result of a single cause, two or more trains or channels are inoperable, regardless of whether the problem was discovered in both trains at the same time. Trains or channels, for reportability purposes, are defined as those trains or channels designed to provide protection against single failures. Many systems containing active components are designed as at least a two-train system. Each train in a two-train system can normally satisfy all of the system functions. SSCs within scope include only safety-related SSCs required by the TS to be operable that are intended to mitigate the consequences of an accident as discussed in Chapters 6 and 15 of the FSAR (or equivalent chapters). Accidents are identified as events of moderate frequency, infrequent incidents, or limiting faults as discussed in Regulatory Guide 1.70 (or equivalent classifications of the three types of events). ANS categorizes these events as Condition II, III and IV type events. ",
        "Examples": "(1) Solenoid-Operated Valve Deficiency During testing, two containment isolation valves failed to function as a result of improper air gaps in the solenoid-operated valves that controlled the supply of instrument air to the containment isolation valves. The valves were powered from the same electrical division. Therefore, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii) (common cause inoperability of independent trains or channels) would not apply. The two valves isolated fluid process lines in two different systems. Thus, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) (condition that could have prevented fulfillment of the safety function of a structure or system) would apply only if engineering judgment indicates that there was a reasonable expectation of preventing fulfillment of the safety function for redundant valves within the same system.14 However, this criterion would certainly apply if a single cause (such as a design inadequacy) induced the improper air gaps, thus preventing fulfillment of the safety function of two trains or channels in different systems. ### (2) Degraded Valve Stems A motor-operated valve in one train of a system was found with a crack 75 percent through the stem. Although the valve stem did not fail, engineering evaluation indicated that further cracking would occur that could have prevented fulfillment of its safety function. As a result, the train was not considered capable of performing its specified safety function. The valve stem was replaced with a new one. The root cause was determined to be environmentally assisted stress-corrosion cracking that resulted from installation of an inadequate material some years earlier. The same inadequate material had been installed in a similar valve in a different system at the same time. The similar valve was exposed to similar environmental conditions as the first valve. The condition is reportable under this criterion if engineering judgment indicates that there was a reasonable expectation of preventing fulfillment of the safety function of both affected trains. This depends on details such as whether the second valve stem was also significantly degraded and, if not, whether any future degradation of the second valve stem would have been discovered and corrected, as a result of routine maintenance programs, before it could become problematic. ### (3) Overpressure Due to Thermal Expansion It was determined that a number of liquid-filled and isolated containment penetration lines in multiple safety systems were not adequately designed to accommodate the internal pressure buildup that could occur because of thermal expansion caused by heatup after a design-basis accident. The problem existed because the original design failed to consider this effect following a postulated accident. 14 Or, alternatively, that there was reasonable doubt that the safety function would have been fulfilled if the affected trains had been called upon to perform them. The condition is reportable under this criterion because there was a reasonable expectation of preventing fulfillment of the safety function of multiple trains or channels as a result of a single cause. ### (4) Cable Degradation One of three component cooling water pumps tripped due to a ground fault on a power cable leading to the pump. The likely cause was determined to be moisture permeation into the cable insulation over time in a section of cable that was exposed to water. The event is reportable under this criterion if engineering judgment indicates that there was a reasonable expectation of preventing fulfillment of the safety function of an additional train in a different system as a result of the same cause. For example, if cable testing indicates that another cable to safety-related equipment was likely to fail as a result of the same cause, the event is reportable. ### (5) Overstressed Valve Yokes It was determined that numerous motor-operated valve yokes experienced overthrusting that exceeded design-basis stress levels. The cause was lack of knowledge that resulted in inadequate design engineering at the time the designs were performed. Some of the motor-operated valve yokes, in different systems, were being overstressed enough during routine operations that, although they were currently capable of performing their specified safety functions, the overstressing would, with the passage of time, render them incapable of performing those functions. The condition is reportable under this criterion if engineering judgment indicates that there was a reasonable expectation of preventing fulfillment of the safety function of trains or channels in two or more different systems.1 ### (6) Heat Exchanger Fouling Periodic monitoring of heat exchanger performance indicated that two heat exchangers in two different systems required cleaning in order to ensure they would remain operable. The degree of fouling was within the range of the normal expectations upon which the monitoring and maintenance procedures were based. The event is not reportable under this criterion because there was not a reasonable expectation of preventing the fulfillment of the safety function of the heat exchangers. ### (7) Pump Vibration Based on increasing vibration trends, identified by routine vibration monitoring, it was determined that a pump's bearings required replacement. Other pumps in different systems with similar designs and service histories experience similar bearing degradation. However, it is expected that the degradation will be detected and corrected before failure occurs. 15 Or, alternatively, there was reasonable doubt that the safety function would have been fulfilled if the affected trains had been called upon to perform them. Such bearing degradation is not reportable under this criterion because it is normal and expected. ### 3.3 Followup Notification This section addresses 10 CFR 50.72(c), \"Followup Notification.\" These notifications are in addition to making the required initial telephone notifications under 10 CFR 50.72(a) or (b). Reporting under this paragraph is intended to provide the NRC with timely notification when an event becomes more serious or additional information or new analysis clarifies an event. The paragraph also authorizes the NRC to maintain a continuous communications channel for acquiring necessary followup information. <table> <tr> <th>§ 50.72(c)</th> <th>§ 50.73</th> </tr> <tr> <td>\"Followup notification. With respect to the telephone notifications made under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, in addition to making the required initial notification, each licensee shall, during the course of the event:</td> <td>There is no corresponding requirement in 10 CFR 50.73.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>(1) Immediately report</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>(i) any further degradation in the level of safety of the plant or other worsening plant conditions, including those that require the declaration of any of the Emergency Classes, if such a declaration has not been previously made, or</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>(ii) any change from one Emergency Class to another, or</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>(iii) a termination of the Emergency Class.</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>(2) Immediately report</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>(i) the results of ensuing evaluations or assessments of plant conditions,</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>(ii) the effectiveness of response or protective measures taken, and</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>(iii) information related to plant behavior that is not understood.</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>(3) Maintain an open, continuous communication channel with the NRC Operations Center upon request by the NRC.\"</td> <td></td> </tr> </table> ## Discussion These criteria are intended to provide the NRC with timely notification when an event becomes more serious or additional information or new analyses clarify an event. They also permit the NRC to maintain a continuous communications channel because of the need for continuing followup information or because of telecommunications problems. With regard to the open, continuous communications channel, licensees have a responsibility to provide enough on-shift personnel, knowledgeable about plant operations and emergency plan implementation, to enable timely, accurate, and reliable reporting of operating events without interfering with plant operation as discussed in the Statements of Consideration for the rule (48 FR 33850 published on July 26, 1983, 48 FR 39039 published on August 29, 1983, and 65 FR 63769 published on October 25, 2000) and IN 85-80, \"Timely Declaration of an Emergency Class, Implementation of an Emergency Plan, and Emergency Notifications,\" dated October 15, 1985. ## 4. EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM REPORTING This section describes the ENS referenced in 10 CFR 50.72 and provides general and specific guidelines for ENS reporting."
